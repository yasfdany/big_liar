## About Flame

Flame is a modular Flutter game engine that provides a complete set of out-of-the-way solutions for
games. It takes advantage of the powerful infrastructure provided by Flutter but simplifies the code
you need to build your projects.

It provides you with a simple yet effective game loop implementation, and the necessary
functionalities that you might need in a game. For instance; input, images, sprites, sprite sheets,
animations, collision detection, and a component system that we call Flame Component System (FCS for
short).

We also provide stand-alone packages that extend the Flame functionality which can be found in the
[Bridge Packages](bridge_packages/bridge_packages.md) section.

You can pick and choose whichever parts you want, as they are all independent and modular.

The engine and its ecosystem are constantly being improved by the community, so please feel free to
reach out, open issues and PRs as well as make suggestions.

Give us a star if you want to help give the engine exposure and grow the community. :)

## Installation

Add the `flame` package as a dependency in your `pubspec.yaml` by running the following command:

```console
flutter pub add flame
```

The latest version can be found on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flame/install).

then run `flutter pub get` and you are ready to start using it!

## Getting started

There is a set of tutorials that you can follow to get started in the
[tutorials folder](https://github.com/flame-engine/flame/tree/main/doc/tutorials).

Simple examples for all features can be found in the
[examples folder](https://github.com/flame-engine/flame/tree/main/examples).

To run Flame you need use the `GameWidget`, which is just another widget that can live anywhere in
your widget tree. You can use it as the root widget of your app, or as a child of another widget.

Here is a simple example of how to use the `GameWidget`:

```dart
import 'package:flame/game.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(
    GameWidget(
      game: FlameGame(),
    ),
  );
}
```

In Flame we provide a concept called the Flame Component System (FCS), which is a way to organize
your game objects in a way that makes it easy to manage them. You can read more about it in the
[Components](flame/components/components.md) section.

When you want to start a new game you either have to extend the `FlameGame` class or the `World`
class. The `FlameGame` is the root of your game and is responsible for managing the game loop and
the components. The `World` class is a component that can be used to create a world in your game.

So to create a simple game you can do something like this:

```dart
import 'package:flame/game.dart';
import 'package:flame/components.dart';
import 'package:flutter/widgets.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(
    GameWidget(
      game: FlameGame(world: MyWorld()),
    ),
  );
}

class MyWorld extends World {
  @override
  Future<void> onLoad() async {
    add(Player(position: Vector2(0, 0)));
  }
}
```

As you can see, we have created a `MyWorld` class that extends the `World` class. We have overridden
the `onLoad` method to add a `Player` component (which doesn't exist yet) to the world. In the
`FlameGame` class we by default have a `camera` that is watching the world, and by default it is
looking at the (0, 0) position of the world in the center of the screen, to learn more about the
camera and the world you can read the [Camera Component](flame/camera.md) section.

The `Player` component can be whatever type of component that you want, to get started we recommend
to use the `SpriteComponent` class, which is a component that can render a sprite (image) on the
screen.

For example something like this:

```dart
import 'package:flame/components.dart';
import 'package:flame/geometry.dart';
import 'package:flame/extensions.dart';

class Player extends SpriteComponent {
  Player({super.position}) :
    super(size: Vector2.all(200), anchor: Anchor.center);

  @override
  Future<void> onLoad() async {
    sprite = await Sprite.load('player.png');
  }
}
```

In this example, we have created a `Player` class that extends the `SpriteComponent` class. We have
overridden the `onLoad` method to set the sprite of the component to a sprite that we load from an
image file called `player.png`. The image has to be in the `assets/images` directory in your project
(see the [Assets Directory Structure](flame/structure.md)) and you have to add it to the
[assets section](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/assets/assets-and-images) of your `pubspec.yaml` file.
In this class we also set the size of the component to 200x200 and the [anchor](flame/components/position_component.md#anchor)
to the center of the component by sending them to the `super` constructor. We also let the user of
the `Player` class set the position of the component when creating it
(`Player(position: Vector2(0, 0))`).

To handle input on a component you can add any of our [input mixins](flame/inputs/inputs.md) to the
component. For example, if you want to handle tap input you can add the `TapCallbacks` mixin to the
player component, and receive tap events within the bounds of the player component. Or if you want
to handle tap input on the whole world you can add the `TapCallbacks` mixin to the extended `World`
class.

The following example handles taps on the player component, and when the player component is
tapped the size of the player will increase by 50 pixels in both width and height.

```dart
import 'package:flame/components.dart';
import 'package:flame/geometry.dart';
import 'package:flame/extensions.dart';

class Player extends SpriteComponent with TapCallbacks {
  Player({super.position}) :
    super(size: Vector2.all(200), anchor: Anchor.center);

  @override
  Future<void> onLoad() async {
    sprite = await Sprite.load('player.png');
  }

  @override
  void onTapUp(TapUpEvent info) {
    size += Vector2.all(50);
  }
}
```

This is just a simple example of how to get started with Flame, there are many more features that you
can use (and probably need) to create your game, but this should give you a good starting point.

You can also check out the [awesome flame repository](https://github.com/flame-engine/awesome-flame#user-content-articles--tutorials),
it contains quite a lot of good tutorials and articles written by the community to get you started
with Flame.

## Outside of the scope of the engine

Games sometimes require complex feature sets depending on what the game is all about. Some of these
feature sets are outside of the scope of the Flame Engine ecosystem, in this section you can find
them, and also some recommendations of packages/services that can be used:

### Multiplayer (netcode)

Flame doesn't bundle any network feature, which may be needed to write online multiplayer games.

If you are building a multiplayer game, here are some recommendations of packages/services:

- [Nakama](https://github.com/obrunsmann/flutter_nakama/): An open-source server designed
  to power modern games and apps.
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/): Provides dozens of services that can be used to write
  simpler multiplayer experiences.
- [Supabase](https://supabase.com/): A cheaper alternative to Firebase, based on Postgres.

# Basic Concepts

Before delving into the details, let's explore some key concepts and terminology used in 3D
rendering and how they apply to `flame_3d`.

## Vertices, Surfaces, Meshes, and Models

A **vertex** is a point in 3D space (think `Vector3`), with a few more properties such as a normal
vector, texture coordinates, color and joint information.

Using vertices arranged in triangles, you can create a **surface**. A surface is simply a collection
of triangles that share the same material.

Then, you can group multiple surfaces into a **mesh** - a "solid" shape in 3D world. A mesh can be
as simple as a cube or a sphere, and many pre-defined options are provided by Flame, such as `Cube`,
`Sphere`, `Plane`, and `Cylinder`. You can also create custom meshes by providing your own vertices
and triangle indices.

Finally, a **model** is a collection of meshes, usually loaded from an external file. Models can
also contain animations, which can be played on the model class.

Typically, for most games, unless you are working with basic shapes and polygons, all your
components will be `ModelComponent`s loaded from external model files. Currently, `flame_3d`
supports the formats `OBJ` (for very simple models, only vertices) and `GLTF` or `GLB` (for complex
models, with custom materials and animations).

## Component Hierarchy

The main building block of a 3D scene is the `Component3D`, which is the base class for all 3D:

```{include} diagrams/flame_3d_components.md

```

Instead of extending `World` directly, your `FlameGame`'s world must be an instance `World3D`. You
can add normal Flame `Component`s to it, which will be rendered as usual, and you can also add
`Component3D`s, which will be rendered in 3D space. You can also add `LightComponent`s to the
`World3D` (note: as of now, they need to be added to the root of the world), which will add light
sources to the scene. Light sources are not rendered themselves, just change how other
`Component3D`s are rendered.

# flame_3d

```{note}
`flame_3d` is an extremely **experimental** package that is subject to many
breaking changes at any time and without any warning. We do not consider it to
be ready for production; but if you want to trail-blaze in a fresh, new cool
space, feel free to give it a try and help us improve it!

# Getting Started

There are a few important things to note before you even start playing with this package.

The GPU-powered 3D support depends on the still experimental
[Flutter GPU](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Flutter-GPU), which in turn depends on
Impeller. This means a few things:

- Since **Flutter GPU** and **Impeller** are still experimental, this package is also considered
  experimental and may have breaking changes at any time.
- The only platforms that we have explicitly tested so far for support were Android, iOS, and macOS.
- You need to enable Impeller, if not already enabled by default (see below).

## Enabling Impeller

Then, you need to enable Impeller, if not already enabled by default. For example, for macOS, add
the following to the generated `macos/runner/Info.plist` directory:

```xml
<dict>
  ...
  <key>FLTEnableImpeller</key>
  <true/>
  <key>FLTEnableFlutterGPU</key>
  <true/>
</dict>
```

Alternatively, you can run Flutter with this flag instead:

```bash
flutter run --enable-flutter-gpu
```

## Playground & Examples

You can find a "playground"-style example of using `flame_3d` in the `packages/flame_3d/example`
directory. It contains multiple "setups" that you can switch using the built-in console commands.

You can also find three more complex examples below:

- [Defend the Donut](https://github.com/flame-engine/defend_the_donut/) - a simple first-person
  spaceship game involving a giant space donut.
- [Collect the Donut](https://github.com/luanpotter/collect_the_donut) - a simple third-person game
  where you control a low-poly rogue and can attack skeletons and collect donuts.
- [Flutter & Friends 2025 Workshop](https://github.com/luanpotter/flutter_and_friends_slides) - our
  talk at Flutter & Friends 2025, which includes a demo showcasing how to setup multiple camera
  styles.

# Audio

Playing audio is essential for most games, so we made it simple!

First you have to add [flame_audio](https://github.com/flame-engine/flame_audio) to your dependency
list in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flame_audio: VERSION
```

The latest version can be found on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flame_audio/install).

After installing the `flame_audio` package, you can add audio files in the assets section of your
`pubspec.yaml` file. Make sure that the audio files exists in the paths that you provide.

The default directory for `FlameAudio` is `assets/audio` (which can be changed by providing your own
instance of `AudioCache`).

For the examples below, your `pubspec.yaml` file needs to contain something like this:

```yaml
flutter:
  assets:
    - assets/audio/explosion.mp3
    - assets/audio/music.mp3
```

Then you have the following methods at your disposal:

```dart
import 'package:flame_audio/flame_audio.dart';

// For shorter reused audio clips, like sound effects
FlameAudio.play('explosion.mp3');

// For looping an audio file
FlameAudio.loop('music.mp3');

// For playing a longer audio file
FlameAudio.playLongAudio('music.mp3');

// For looping a longer audio file
FlameAudio.loopLongAudio('music.mp3');

// For background music that should be paused/played when the pausing/resuming
// the game
FlameAudio.bgm.play('music.mp3');
```

The difference between the `play/loop` and `playLongAudio/loopLongAudio` is that `play/loop` makes
use of optimized features that allow sounds to be looped without gaps between their iterations, and
almost no drop on the game frame rate will happen. You should whenever possible, prefer the former
methods.

`playLongAudio/loopLongAudio` allows for audios of any length to be played, but they do create frame
rate drop, and the looped audio will have a small gap between iterations.

You can use [the `Bgm` class](bgm.md) (via `FlameAudio.bgm`) to play looping background music
tracks. The `Bgm` class lets Flame automatically manage the pausing and resuming of background music
tracks when the game is sent to background or comes back to the foreground.

You can use [the `AudioPool` class](audio_pool.md) if you want to fire quick sound effects in a very
efficient manner. `AudioPool` will keep a pool of `AudioPlayer`s preloaded with a given sound, and
allow you to play them very fast in quick succession.

Some file formats that work across devices and that we recommend are: MP3, OGG and WAV.

This bridge library (flame_audio) uses [audioplayers](https://github.com/bluefireteam/audioplayers)
in order to allow for playing multiple sounds simultaneously (crucial in a game). You can check the
link for a more in-depth explanation.

Both on `play` and `loop` you can pass an additional optional double parameter, the `volume`
(defaults to `1.0`).

Both the `play` and `loop` methods return an instance of an `AudioPlayer` from the
[audioplayers](https://github.com/bluefireteam/audioplayers) lib, that allows you to stop, pause and
configure other parameters.

In fact you can always use `AudioPlayer`s directly to gain full control over how your audio is played
-- the `FlameAudio` class is just a wrapper for common functionality.

## Caching

You can pre-load your assets. Audios need to be stored in the memory the first time they
are requested; therefore, the first time you play each mp3 you might get a delay. In order to
pre-load your audios, just use:

```dart
await FlameAudio.audioCache.load('explosion.mp3');
```

You can load all your audios in the beginning in your game's `onLoad` method so that they always
play smoothly. To load multiple audio files, use the `loadAll` method:

```dart
await FlameAudio.audioCache.loadAll(['explosion.mp3', 'music.mp3']);
```

Finally, you can use the `clear` method to remove a file that has been loaded into the cache:

```dart
FlameAudio.audioCache.clear('explosion.mp3');
```

There is also a `clearCache` method, that clears the whole cache.

This might be useful if, for instance, your game has multiple levels and each has a different
set of sounds and music.

# AudioPool

An AudioPool is a provider of AudioPlayers that are pre-loaded with local assets to minimize audio
playback delays. This is particularly useful in fast-paced games where sound effects need to trigger
quickly and potentially overlap with each other.

A single AudioPool always plays the same sound, usually a quick sound effect that might need to be
played repeatedly or simultaneously, such as:

- Shooting sounds in a space shooter
- Jump sounds in a platformer
- Explosion effects
- Collecting coins or items
- Enemy hit sounds

## How It Works

AudioPool works by creating and pre-loading a pool of AudioPlayer instances that are all configured
to play the same sound. When you need to play the sound:

1. The pool gives you an available player from its collection
2. If no player is available, a new player is created on demand
3. When a sound finishes playing or is stopped manually, the player is returned to the pool for reuse,
   unless the pool already has reached its maximum size limit, in which case the player is released

This approach significantly reduces latency compared to creating new AudioPlayer instances on demand,
while also managing memory by limiting the maximum size of the pool.

## Creating an AudioPool

There are multiple ways to create an AudioPool:

### Using FlameAudio Helper

The simplest approach is to use the helper method in `FlameAudio`, which conveniently uses Flame's
global audio cache:

```dart
import 'package:flame_audio/flame_audio.dart';

Future<void> loadSounds() async {
  // Create a pool with minimum 1 player and maximum 2 players
  // This automatically uses Flame's global audio cache
  AudioPool explosionSoundPool = await FlameAudio.createPool(
    'explosion.mp3',
    minPlayers: 1,
    maxPlayers: 2,
  );
}
```

### Creating Directly with Source

You can also create an AudioPool by directly using the static factory methods:

```dart
import 'package:audioplayers/audioplayers.dart';
import 'package:flame_audio/flame_audio.dart';

Future<void> loadSounds() async {
  // Create a pool with a specific Source
  AudioPool explosionSoundPool = await AudioPool.create(
    source: AssetSource('explosion.mp3'),
    minPlayers: 1,
    maxPlayers: 2,
    audioCache: FlameAudio.audioCache, // Optional
  );
}
```

### Creating from Asset Path

For convenience, you can create an AudioPool from just the asset path:

```dart
import 'package:flame_audio/flame_audio.dart';

Future<void> loadSounds() async {
  AudioPool explosionSoundPool = await AudioPool.createFromAsset(
    path: 'explosion.mp3',
    minPlayers: 1,
    maxPlayers: 2,
    audioCache: FlameAudio.audioCache, // Optional
  );
}
```

The parameters are:

- `source` or `path`: The audio source to play (either as a Source object or asset path)
- `minPlayers`: The initial number of AudioPlayers to create and preload (default: 1)
- `maxPlayers`: The maximum number of AudioPlayers that can be kept in the pool
- `audioCache`: Optional AudioCache instance to use
- `audioContext`: Optional audio context to be used by all players in the pool

## Using an AudioPool

Once you've created an AudioPool, you can start playing sounds:

```dart
// Play the sound with default volume (1.0)
final stopFunction = await audioPool.start();

// Play the sound with custom volume
final stopFunction = await audioPool.start(volume: 0.5);

// Later, you can stop the sound if needed
await stopFunction();
```

The `start()` method returns a `StopFunction` that you can call to stop the sound before it completes
naturally.

## Managing the Pool

AudioPool provides a `dispose()` method to release resources when you no longer need the pool:

```dart
// When you're done with the pool
await audioPool.dispose();
```

## Example Usage

Here's a complete example showing how to use AudioPools in a Flame game:

```dart
import 'package:flame/game.dart';
import 'package:flame_audio/flame_audio.dart';

class MyGame extends FlameGame {
  late AudioPool laserSound;
  late AudioPool explosionSound;

  @override
  Future<void> onLoad() async {
    // Load sound effects into audio pools
    laserSound = await FlameAudio.createPool(
      'laser.mp3',
      minPlayers: 3,
      maxPlayers: 6,
    );

    explosionSound = await FlameAudio.createPool(
      'explosion.mp3',
      minPlayers: 2,
      maxPlayers: 4,
    );
  }

  void fireLaser() async {
    // Play the laser sound effect - can be called rapidly
    final stop = await laserSound.start();

    // If you need to stop the sound early:
    // await stop();
  }

  void enemyDestroyed() async {
    // Play explosion sound effect
    await explosionSound.start(volume: 0.7);
  }

  @override
  Future<void> onRemove() async {
    await super.onRemove();

    // Clean up resources when the game component is removed
    await laserSound.dispose();
    await explosionSound.dispose();
  }
}
```

# Looping Background Music

With the `Bgm` class, you can manage looping of background music tracks with regards to application
(or game) lifecycle state changes.

When the application is terminated, or sent to background, `Bgm` will automatically pause
the currently playing music track. Similarly, when the application is resumed, `Bgm` will resume the
background music. Manually pausing and resuming your tracks is also supported.

For this class to function properly, the observer must be registered by calling the following:

```dart
FlameAudio.bgm.initialize();
```

**IMPORTANT Note:** The `initialize` function must be called at a point in time where an instance of
the `WidgetsBinding` class already exists. Best practice is to put this call inside of your game's
`onLoad` method`.

In cases where you're done with background music but still want to keep the application/game
running, use the `dispose` function to remove the observer.

```dart
FlameAudio.bgm.dispose();
```

To play a looping background music track, run:

```dart
import 'package:flame_audio/flame_audio.dart';

FlameAudio.bgm.play('adventure-track.mp3');
```

You must have an appropriate folder structure and add the files to the `pubspec.yaml` file, as
explained in [Flame Audio documentation](audio.md).

## Caching music files

The `Bgm` class will use the static instance of `FlameAudio` for storing cached
music files by default.

So in order to pre-load music, you can use the same recommendations from the
[Flame Audio documentation](audio.md).

You can optionally create your own `Bgm` instances with different backing `AudioCache`s,
if you so desire.

## Methods

### Play

The `play` function takes in a `String` that should be a path that points to the location of the
music file to be played (following the Flame Audio folder structure requirements).

You can pass an additional optional `double` parameter which is the `volume` (defaults to `1.0`).

Examples:

```dart
FlameAudio.bgm.play('music/boss-fight/level-382.mp3');
```

```dart
FlameAudio.bgm.play('music/world-map.mp3', volume: .25);
```

### Stop

To stop a currently playing background music track, just call `stop`.

```dart
FlameAudio.bgm.stop();
```

### Pause and Resume

To manually pause and resume background music you can use the `pause` and `resume` functions.

`FlameAudio.bgm` automatically handles pausing and resuming the currently playing background music
track. Manually `pausing` prevents the app/game from auto-resuming when focus is given back to the
app/game.

```dart
FlameAudio.bgm.pause();
```

```dart
FlameAudio.bgm.resume();
```

# Collision Detection 💥

Flame comes with a powerful built-in [collision detection system](https://docs.flame-engine.org/latest/flame/collision_detection.html),
but this API is not strongly typed. Components always get the colliding component as a
`PositionComponent` and developers need to manually check what type of class it is.

`flame_behaviors` is all about enforcing a strongly typed API. It provides a special behavior
called `CollisionBehavior` that describes the type of entity being targeted for collision. It
does not, however, do any real collision detection. That is done by the
`PropagatingCollisionBehavior`.

The `PropagatingCollisionBehavior` handles the collision detection by registering a hitbox on the
parent entity. When that hitbox has a collision, the `PropagatingCollisionBehavior` checks if the
component that the parent entity is colliding with contains the target entity type specified in
`CollisionBehavior`.

There are two main benefits of letting the `PropagatingCollisionBehavior` handle the collision detection,
the first and most important one is performance. By only registering collision callbacks on the
entities themselves, the collision detection system does not have to go through any "collidable"
behaviors, for which there could be many per entity. We only do that now if we confirm a collision
has happened.

The second benefit is that it allows for [separation of concerns][separation_of_concerns].
Each `CollisionBehavior` handles a specific collision use case and ensures that the developer does
not have to write a bunch of if statements in one big method to figure out what it is colliding
with.

A good use case of this collisional behavior pattern can be seen in the `flame_behaviors`
[example](https://github.com/flame-engine/flame/tree/main/packages/flame_behaviors/example)

```dart
class MyEntityCollisionBehavior
    extends CollisionBehavior<MyCollidingEntity, MyParentEntity> {
  @override
  void onCollisionStart(
    Set<Vector2> intersectionPoints,
    MyCollidingEntity other,
  ) {
    // We are starting colliding with MyCollidingEntity
  }

  @override
  void onCollisionEnd(MyCollidingEntity other) {
    // We stopped colliding with MyCollidingEntity
  }
}

class MyParentEntity extends Entity {
  MyParentEntity()
    : super(
        behaviors: [
          PropagatingCollisionBehavior(RectangleHitbox()),
          MyEntityCollisionBehavior(),
        ],
      );
   ...
}
```

# Event Behaviors ⌨

The `flame_behaviors` package also provides event behaviors. These behaviors are a layer over the
existing Flame event mixins for components. These behaviors will trigger when the user interacts
with their parent entity. So these events are always relative to the parent entity.

## TappableBehavior

The `TappableBehavior` allows developers to use the [tap events][flame_tap_docs] from Flame on
their entities.

```dart
class MyTappableBehavior extends TappableBehavior<MyEntity> {
  @override
  void onTapDown(TapDownEvent event) {
    // Do something on tap down update event.
  }
}
```

## DraggableBehavior

The `DraggableBehavior` allows developers to use the [drag events][flame_drag_docs] from Flame on
their entities.

```dart
class MyDraggableBehavior extends DraggableBehavior<MyEntity> {
  @override
  void onDragUpdate(DragUpdateEvent event) {
    // Do something on drag update event.
  }
}
```

# Getting Started 🚀

## Prerequisites 📝

In order to use Flame Behaviors you must have the [Flame package][flame_package_link] added to
your project.

> **Note**: Flame Behaviors requires Flame `">=1.10.0 <2.0.0"`

## Installing 🧑‍💻

Let's start by adding the [`flame_behaviors`][flame_behaviors_package_link] package:

```shell
# 📦 Add the flame_behaviors package from pub.dev to your project
flutter pub add flame_behaviors
```

## Entity

The entity is the building block of a game. It represents a visual game object that can hold
multiple `Behavior`s, which in turn define how the entity behaves.

```dart
// Define a custom entity by extending `Entity`.
class MyEntity extends Entity {
  MyEntity() : super(behaviors: [MyBehavior()]);
}
```

### Types of Entities

There are two types of entities in Flame Behaviors:

- `Entity`: A generic entity that can be used to represent any game object.
- `PositionedEntity`: An entity that has a position and size, it is based on the `PositionComponent`.

These entities use the `EntityMixin` which is a mixin that provides the basic functionality
for an entity.

If you want to turn any component into an entity, you can use this mixin. For instance, if you want
to turn a `SpriteComponent` into an entity, you can do the following:

```dart
class MySpriteEntity extends SpriteComponent with EntityMixin {
  Future<void> onLoad() async {
    // Add behaviors to the entity.
    add(MyBehavior());
  }
}
```

You can even turn a `FlameGame` into an entity:

```dart
class MyGame extends FlameGame with EntityMixin {
  Future<void> onLoad() async {
    // Add behaviors to the entity.
    add(MyGameBehavior());
  }
}
```

## Behavior

A behavior is a component that defines how an entity behaves. It can be attached to any component
that uses the `EntityMixin` and handle a specific behavior for that entity. Behaviors can either
be generic for any entity or you can specify the specific type of entity that a behavior requires:

```dart
// Can be added to any type of Entity.
class MyGenericBehavior extends Behavior {
  ...
}

// Can only be added to MyEntity and subclasses of it.
class MySpecificBehavior extends Behavior<MyEntity> {
  ...
}
```

### Behavior Composition

Each behavior can have its own `Component`s for adding extra functionality related to the behavior.
For instance a `TimerComponent` can implement a time-based behavioral activity:

```dart
class MyBehavior extends Behavior {
  @override
  Future<void> onLoad() async {
    await add(TimerComponent(period: 5, repeat: true, onTick: _onTick));
  }

  void _onTick() {
    // Do something every 5 seconds.
  }
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> A `Behavior` is a non-visual component that describes how a visual component (Entity)
> behaves therefore, a behavior can't have its own `Behavior`s.

## What's Next

The following sections will show you how to use Flame Behaviors for common game development tasks:

- [Handling Game Input](event-behaviors.md)
- [Handling Collisions](collision-detection.md)

Flame Behaviors also provides some conventions on how to name and organize your code:

# Coding Conventions

> [!Note]
> The following coding conventions are simply recommendations and are completely
> optional. Feel free to use whatever coding conventions you prefer.

## Entities

Entities should not contain any behavioral logic, instead they should be composed of behaviors. This
allows for more flexible and reusable code. Entities should not do any direct rendering, instead they
should add child components to handle the visualization of the entity.

### Example of entities

✅ **Good**

```dart
class Player extends Entity {
  Player() {
    // Behaviors
    add(JumpingBehavior());
    add(AttackingBehavior());

    // Components
    add(SpriteComponent(...));
  }
}
```

❌ **Bad**

```dart
class Player extends Entity {
  void update(double dt) {
    if (isJumping) {
      // Jump logic
    }

    if (isAttacking) {
      // Attack logic
    }
  }

  void render(Canvas canvas) {
    // Render player
    canvas.drawImage(...);
  }
}
```

## Behaviors

Behaviors should only contain code related to the behavioral logic it describes. Behaviors should
never do any direct rendering.

A behavior is allowed to have its own components for adding extra functionality related to the
behavior. For example, a behavior that makes an entity jump could have a `TimerComponent` to ensure
that the entity can only jump once every 0.5 seconds. And that behavior can also use a
`KeyboardHandler` mixin to listen for the jump key to trigger the jump. Any logic that is not
related to the behavior should not be in the behavior.

### Example of behaviors

✅ **Good**

```dart
class JumpingBehavior extends Behavior<Entity> with KeyboardHandler {
  bool isJumping = false;

  @override
  bool onKeyEvent(RawKeyEvent event, Set<LogicalKeyboardKey> keysPressed) {
    isJumping = keysPressed.contains(LogicalKeyboardKey.space);
    return true;
  }

  @override
  void update(double dt) {
    if (isJumping) {
      // Jump logic
    }
  }
}
```

❌ **Bad**

```dart
class JumpBehavior extends Behavior<Entity> with KeyboardHandler {
  bool isJumping = false;
  bool isAttacking = false;

  @override
  bool onKeyEvent(RawKeyEvent event, Set<LogicalKeyboardKey> keysPressed) {
    isJumping = keysPressed.contains(LogicalKeyboardKey.space);
    isAttacking = keysPressed.contains(LogicalKeyboardKey.keyA);
    return true;
  }


  void update(double dt) {
    if (isJumping) {
      // Jump logic
    }
    if (isAttacking) {
      // Attack logic
    }
  }

  void render(Canvas canvas) {
    // Render something
    canvas.drawImage(...);
  }
}
```

# flame_bloc

`flame_bloc` is a bridge library for using [Bloc](https://bloclibrary.dev/) in your Flame
game. `flame_bloc` offers a simple and natural (as in similar to flutter_bloc) way to use blocs and
cubits inside a FlameGame. Bloc offers way to make game state changes predictable by regulating when
a game state change can occur and offers a single way to change game state throughout an entire
Game.

To use it in your game you just need to add `flame_bloc` to your pubspec.yaml, as can be seen in the
[Flame Bloc example](https://github.com/flame-engine/flame/tree/main/packages/flame_bloc/example)
and in the pub.dev [installation instructions](https://pub.dev/packages/flame_bloc).

## How to use

Lets assume we have a bloc that handles player inventory, first we need to make it available to our
components.

We can do that by using `FlameBlocProvider` component:

```dart
class MyGame extends FlameGame {
  @override
  Future<void> onLoad() async {
    await add(
      FlameBlocProvider<PlayerInventoryBloc, PlayerInventoryState>(
        create: () => PlayerInventoryBloc(),
        children: [
          Player(),
          // ...
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

With the above changes, the `Player` component will now have access to our bloc.

If more than one bloc needs to be provided, `FlameMultiBlocProvider` can be used in a similar
fashion:

```dart
class MyGame extends FlameGame {
  @override
  Future<void> onLoad() async {
    await add(
      FlameMultiBlocProvider(
        providers: [
          FlameBlocProvider<PlayerInventoryBloc, PlayerInventoryState>(
            create: () => PlayerInventoryBloc(),
          ),
          FlameBlocProvider<PlayerStatsBloc, PlayerStatsState>(
            create: () => PlayerStatsBloc(),
          ),
        ],
        children: [
          Player(),
          // ...
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

Listening to states changes at the component level can be done with two approaches:

By using `FlameBlocListener` component:

```dart
class Player extends PositionComponent {
  @override
  Future<void> onLoad() async {
    await add(
      FlameBlocListener<PlayerInventoryBloc, PlayerInventoryState>(
        listener: (state) {
          updateGear(state);
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

Or by using `FlameBlocListenable` mixin:

```dart

class Player extends PositionComponent
    with FlameBlocListenable<PlayerInventoryBloc, PlayerInventoryState> {

  @override
  void onNewState(state) {
    updateGear(state);
  }
}

```

If all your component need is to simply access a bloc, the `FlameBlocReader` mixin can be applied to
a component:

```dart
class Player extends PositionComponent
    with FlameBlocReader<PlayerStatsBloc, PlayerStatsState> {

  void takeHit() {
    bloc.add(const PlayerDamaged());
  }
}

```

Note that one limitation of the mixin is that it can access only a single bloc.

## Full Example

You can check an example
[here](https://github.com/flame-engine/flame/tree/main/packages/flame_bloc/example).

# Components

## FlameBlocProvider

FlameBlocProvider is a Component which creates and provides a bloc to its children.  
The bloc will only live while this component is alive. It is used as a dependency injection (DI)
widget so that a single instance of a bloc can be provided to multiple Components within a subtree.

FlameBlocProvider should be used to create new blocs which will be made available to the rest of the
subtree.

```dart
FlameBlocProvider<BlocA, BlocAState>(
  create: () => BlocA(),
  children: [...]
);
```

FlameBlocProvider can be used to provide an existing bloc to a new portion of the Component tree.

```dart
FlameBlocProvider<BlocA, BlocAState>.value(
  value: blocA,
  children: [...],
);
```

## FlameMultiBlocProvider

Similar to FlameBlocProvider, but provides multiples blocs down to the component tree

```dart
FlameMultiBlocProvider(
  providers: [
    FlameBlocProvider<BlocA, BlocAState>(
      create: () => BlocA(),
    ),
    FlameBlocProvider<BlocB, BlocBState>.value(
      create: () => BlocB(),
    ),
    ],
  children: [...],
)
```

## FlameBlocListener

FlameBlocListener is Component which can listen to changes in a Bloc state. It invokes
the `onNewState` in response to state changes in the bloc. For fine-grained control over when
the `onNewState` function is called an optional `listenWhen` can be provided. `listenWhen` takes the
previous bloc state and current bloc state and returns a boolean. If `listenWhen` returns
true, `onNewState` will be called with `state`. If `listenWhen` returns false, `onNewState` will not
be called with `state`.

alternatively you can use `FlameBlocListenable` mixin to listen state changes on Component.

```dart
FlameBlocListener<GameStatsBloc, GameStatsState>(
  listenWhen: (previousState, newState) {
      // return true/false to determine whether or not
      // to call listener with state
  },
  onNewState: (state) {
          // do stuff here based on state
  },
)
```

## FlameBlocListenable

FlameBlocListenable is an alternative to FlameBlocListener to listen state changes.

```dart
class ComponentA extends Component
    with FlameBlocListenable<BlocA, BlocAState> {

  @override
  bool listenWhen(PlayerState previousState, PlayerState newState) {
    // return true/false to determine whether or not
    // to call listener with state
  }

  @override
  void onNewState(PlayerState state) {
    super.onNewState(state);
    // do stuff here based on state
  }
}
```

## FlameBlocReader

FlameBlocReader is mixin that allows you to read the current state of bloc on Component. It is
Useful for components that needs to only read a bloc current state or to trigger an event on it. You
can have only one reader on Component

```dart

class InventoryReader extends Component
    with FlameBlocReader<InventoryCubit, InventoryState> {}

    /// inside game

    final component = InventoryReader();
    // reading current state
    var state = component.bloc
```

# flame_console

Flame Console is a terminal overlay for Flame games which allows developers to debug and interact
with their games.

It offers an overlay that can be plugged in to your `GameWidget` which when activated will show a
terminal-like interface written with Flutter widgets where commands can be executed to see
information about the running game and components, or perform actions.

It comes with a set of built-in commands, but it is also possible to add custom commands.

## Usage

Flame Console is an overlay, so to use it, you will need to register it in your game widget.

Then, showing the overlay is up to you, below we see an example of a floating action button that will
show the console when pressed.

```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Scaffold(
    body: GameWidget(
      game: _game,
      overlayBuilderMap: {
        'console': (BuildContext context, MyGame game) => FlameConsoleView(
              game: game,
              onClose: () {
                _game.overlays.remove('console');
              },
            ),
      },
    ),
    floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
      heroTag: 'console_button',
      onPressed: () {
        _game.overlays.add('console');
      },
      child: const Icon(Icons.developer_mode),
    ),
  );
}
```

## Built-in commands

- `help` - List available commands and their usage.
- `ls` - List components.
- `rm` - Remove components.
- `debug` - Toggle debug mode on components.
- `pause` - Pauses the game loop.
- `resume` -Resumes the game loop.

## Custom commands

Custom commands can be created by extending the `FlameConsoleCommand` class and adding them to the
the `customCommands` list in the `ConsoleView` widget.

```dart
class MyCustomCommand extends FlameConsoleCommand<MyGame> {
 @override
 String get name => 'my_command';

 @override
 String get description => 'Description of my command';

 // The execute method should return a tuple where the first
 // element is an error message (in case of failure), and the second
 // element is the output of the command.
 @override
 (String?, String) execute(MyGame game, ArgResults args) {
   // do something on the game
   return (null, 'Hello World');
 }
}
```

Then when creating the `ConsoleView` widget, add the custom command to the `customCommands` list.

```dart
ConsoleView(
  game: game,
  customCommands: [MyCustomCommand()],
  onClose: () {
    _game.overlays.remove('console');
  },
),
```

## Customizing the console UI

The console look and feel can also be customized. When creating the `ConsoleView` widget, there are
a couple of properties that can be used to customize it:

- `containerBuilder`: It is used to created the decorated container where the history and the
  command input is displayed.
- `cursorBuilder`: It is used to create the cursor widget.
- `historyBuilder`: It is used to create the scrolling element of the history, by default a simple
  `SingleChildScrollView` is used.
- `cursorColor`: The color of the cursor. Can be used when just wanting to change the color
  of the cursor.
- `textStyle`: The text style of the console.

# Flame fire atlas

Flame fire atlas is a texture atlas lib for Flame. By using `flame_fire_atlas` one can access images
and animations stored in a `.fa` texture atlas by referring to them by their named keys.

## FireAtlas

FireAtlas is a tool for handling texture atlases. Atlases can be created using the
[Fire Atlas Editor](https://fire-atlas.flame-engine.org).

### Creating Atlas

To create a texture atlas open [Fire Atlas Editor](https://fire-atlas.flame-engine.org).

Select new atlas and give the atlas a name, tile width, tile height and an image and press okay.
This will take you to the atlas editor.

To create a new `Sprite` in the atlas, select a portion and click the plus button on top left and
give the selection a name and then select type `Sprite` and press `Create Sprite`. You can now
see a preview in the right panel of editor.

To create a new `SpriteAnimation` in the atlas, select a portion and click the plus button on top
left and give the selection a name and then select type `Animation` and provide `frame count`
and `steps times (in milliseconds)` and select the checkbox to loop the animation, and then
press `Create Animation`. You can now see a preview of the animation in the right panel of the
editor.

Once you are done with editing you can download the fire atlas file from top left with
the `download` icon button.

## Texture atlas

A [Texture atlas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texture_atlas) is an image that contains data from
several smaller images that have been packed together to reduce overall dimensions. With it, you
reduce the number of images loaded and can speed up the loading time of the game.

## Usage

To use the bridge library in your game you just need to add `flame_fire_atlas` to your pubspec.yaml,
as can be seen in
the [Flame Fire Atlas example](https://github.com/flame-engine/flame/tree/main/packages/flame_fire_atlas/example)
and in the pub.dev [installation instructions](https://pub.dev/packages/flame_fire_atlas).

Then you have the following methods at your disposal:

```dart
import 'package:flame_fire_atlas/flame_fire_atlas.dart';

// Load the atlas from your assets
// file at assets/atlas.fa
final atlas = await FireAtlas.loadAsset('atlas.fa');

//or when inside a game instance, the loadFireAtlas can be used:
// file at assets/atlas.fa
final atlas = await loadFireAtlas('atlas.fa');

// Get a Sprite with the given key.
FireAtlas.getSprite('sprite_name')

// Get a SpriteAnimation with the given key.
FireAtlas.getAnimation('animation_name')
```

To use FireAtlas in your game, load the fire atlas file in an `onLoad` method, either in your game
or a component. Then you can use `getSprite` and `getAnimation` to retrieve the mapped assets.

```dart
class ExampleGame extends FlameGame {

  late FireAtlas _atlas;

  @override
  Future<void> onLoad() async {
    _atlas = await loadFireAtlas('atlas.fa');

    add(
      SpriteComponent(
        size: Vector2(50, 50),
        position: Vector2(0, 50),
        sprite: _atlas.getSprite('sprite_name'),
      ),
    );

    add(
      SpriteAnimationComponent(
        size: Vector2(150, 100),
        position: Vector2(150, 100),
        animation: _atlas.getAnimation('animation_name'),
      ),
    );
  }

}
```

# Forge2D

Blue Fire maintains a ported version of the Box2D physics engine and our
version is called Forge2D.

If you want to use Forge2D specifically for Flame you should use our bridge library
[flame_forge2d](https://github.com/flame-engine/flame/tree/main/packages/flame_forge2d) and if you
just want to use it in a Dart project you can use the
[forge2d](https://github.com/flame-engine/forge2d) library directly.

To use it in your game you just need to add `flame_forge2d` to your
`pubspec.yaml`, as can be seen in the [Forge2D
[example](https://github.com/flame-engine/flame/tree/main/packages/flame_forge2d/example)
and the pub. dev [installation
instructions](https://pub.dev/packages/flame_forge2d)](https://pub.dev/packages/flame_forge2d).

## Forge2DGame

If you are going to use Forge2D in your project it can be a good idea to use the Forge2D-specific
`FlameGame` class, `Forge2DGame`.

It is called `Forge2DGame` and supports both the special Forge2D components called `BodyComponents`
as well as normal Flame components.

`Forge2DGame` has a built-in `CameraComponent` and has a zoom level set to 10 by default, so your
components will be a lot bigger than in a normal Flame game. This is due to the speed limit in the
`Forge2D` world, which you would hit very quickly if you are using it with `zoom = 1.0`. You can
easily change the zoom level either by calling `super(zoom: yourZoom)` in your constructor or
doing `game.cameraComponent.viewfinder.zoom = yourZoom;` at a later stage.

If you are previously familiar with Box2D it can be good to know that the whole concept of the
Box2d world is mapped to `world` in the `Forge2DGame` component and every `Body` that you want to
use as a component should be wrapped in a `BodyComponent`, and added to the `world` in your
`Forge2DGame`.

You can have have non-physics-related components in your `Forge2DGame` world's component list along
with your physical entities. When the update is called, it will use the Forge2D physics engine to
properly update every `BodyComponent` and other components in the game will be updated according to
the normal `FlameGame` way.

In `Forge2DGame` the gravity is flipped compared to `Forge2D` to keep the same coordinate system as
in Flame, so a positive y-axis in the gravity like `Vector2(0, 10)` would be pulling bodies
downwards, meanwhile, a negative y-axis would pull them upwards. The gravity can be set directly in
the constructor of the `Forge2DGame`.

A simple `Forge2DGame` implementation example can be seen in the
[examples folder](https://github.com/flame-engine/flame/tree/main/packages/flame_forge2d/example).

## Forge2DWorld

The `Forge2DWorld` is a the world that all your [`BodyComponent`]s live in. In the `Forge2DGame`
there is a `Forge2DWorld` instance called `world` by default, which is where you should add your
`BodyComponent`s.

If you want to swap between worlds you can create your own `Forge2DWorld` instance and assign it
to the `Forge2DGame` instance's `world` property, `game.world = Forge2DWorld()`.

If you would like to re-use a world later and have it keep its physics state you have to make sure
that the bodies aren't destroyed when the world is removed from the game. You can do this by
setting `world.destroyOnRemove` to false, like `game.world.destroyOnRemove = false;`.

## BodyComponent

The `BodyComponent` is a wrapper for the `Forge2D` body, which is the body that the physics engine
is interacting with. To create a `BodyComponent` you can either:

- override `createBody()` and create and return your created body;
- use the default `createBody()` implementation by passing a `BodyDef` instance (and optionally a
  list of `FixtureDef` instances) to the BodyComponent's constructor;
- use the default `createBody()` implementation and assign a `BodyDef` instance to `this.bodyDef`,
  and optionally a list of `FixtureDef` instances to `this.fixtureDefs`.

The `BodyComponent` is by default having `renderBody = true`, since otherwise, it wouldn't show
anything after you have created a `Body` and added the `BodyComponent` to the game. If you want to
turn it off you can just set (or override) `renderBody` to false.

Just like any other Flame component you can add children to the `BodyComponent`, which can be very
useful if you want to add for example animations or other components on top of your body.

The body that you create should be defined according to Flame's coordinate system,
not according to the coordinate system of Forge2D (where the Y-axis is flipped).

:exclamation: In Forge2D you shouldn't add any bodies as children to other components,
since Forge2D doesn't have a concept of nested bodies.
So bodies should live on the top level in the physics world, `Forge2DGame.world`.
So instead of `add(Weapon()))`, `world.add(Weapon())` should be used (as below), and the `Player`
should also of course initially be added to the world.

```dart
class Weapon extends BodyComponent  {
  @override
  void onLoad() {
    ...
  }
}

class Player extends BodyComponent  {
  @override
  void onLoad() {
    world.add(Weapon());
  }
}
```

Later you might want to add bullets coming from your weapon, these are added to the world in the
same sense, but if they are going to be moving very fast, make sure that you set `isBullet = true`
to avoid some tunneling problems.

## Contact callbacks

`Forge2DGame` provides a simple out-of-the-box solution to propagate contact events.

Contact events occur whenever two `Fixture`s meet each other. These events allow listening when
these `Fixture`s begin to come in contact (`beginContact`) and cease being in contact
(`endContact`).

There are multiple ways to listen to these events. One common way is to use the `ContactCallbacks`
class as a mixin in the `BodyComponent` where you are interested in these events.

```dart
class Ball extends BodyComponent with ContactCallbacks {
  ...
  void beginContact(Object other, Contact contact) {
    if (other is Wall) {
      // Do something here.
    }
  }
  ...
}
```

For the above to work, the `Ball`'s `body.userData` or contacting `fixture.userData` must be
set to a `ContactCallback`. And if `Wall` is a `BodyComponent` it's `body.userData` or contacting
`fixture.userData` must be set to `Wall`.

If `userData` is `null` the contact events are ignored, it is `null` by default.

A convenient way of setting `userData` is to assign it when creating the body. For example:

```dart
class Ball extends BodyComponent with ContactCallbacks {
  ...

  @override
  Body createBody() {
    ...
    final bodyDef = BodyDef(
      userData: this,
    );
    ...
  }

}
```

Every time `Ball` and `Wall` begin to come in contact `beginContact` will be called, and once the
fixtures cease being in contact, `endContact` will be called.

An implementation example can be seen in the [Flame Forge2D
example](https://github.com/flame-engine/flame/blob/main/examples/lib/stories/bridge_libraries/flame_forge2d/utils/balls.dart).

# Joints

Joints are used to connect two different bodies together in various ways.
They help to simulate interactions between objects to create hinges, wheels, ropes, chains etc.

One `Body` in a joint may be of type `BodyType.static`. Joints between `BodyType.static` and/or
`BodyType.kinematic` are allowed, but have no effect and use some processing time.

To construct a `Joint`, you need to create a corresponding subclass of `JointDef`and initialize it
with its parameters.

To register a `Joint` use `world.createJoint`and later use `world.destroyJoint` when you want to
remove it.

## Built-in joints

Currently, Forge2D supports the following joints:

- [`ConstantVolumeJoint`](#constantvolumejoint)
- [`DistanceJoint`](#distancejoint)
- [`FrictionJoint`](#frictionjoint)
- [`GearJoint`](#gearjoint)
- [`MotorJoint`](#motorjoint)
- [`MouseJoint`](#mousejoint)
- [`PrismaticJoint`](#prismaticjoint)
- [`PulleyJoint`](#pulleyjoint)
- [`RevoluteJoint`](#revolutejoint)
- [`RopeJoint`](#ropejoint)
- [`WeldJoint`](#weldjoint)
- WheelJoint

### `ConstantVolumeJoint`

This type of joint connects a group of bodies together and maintains a constant volume within them.
Essentially, it is a set of [`DistanceJoint`](#distancejoint)s, that connects all bodies one after
another.

It can for example be useful when simulating "soft-bodies".

```dart
  final constantVolumeJoint = ConstantVolumeJointDef()
    ..frequencyHz = 10
    ..dampingRatio = 0.8;

  bodies.forEach((body) {
    constantVolumeJoint.addBody(body);
  });

  world.createJoint(ConstantVolumeJoint(world, constantVolumeJoint));
```

```{flutter-app}
:sources: ../../examples
:subfolder: stories/bridge_libraries/flame_forge2d/joints
:page: constant_volume_joint
:show: code popup
```

`ConstantVolumeJointDef` requires at least 3 bodies to be added using the `addBody` method. It also
has two optional parameters:

- `frequencyHz`: This parameter sets the frequency of oscillation of the joint. If it is not set to
  0, the higher the value, the less springy each of the compound `DistantJoint`s are.

- `dampingRatio`: This parameter defines how quickly the oscillation comes to rest. It ranges from
  0 to 1, where 0 means no damping and 1 indicates critical damping.

### `DistanceJoint`

A `DistanceJoint` constrains two points on two bodies to remain at a fixed distance from each other.

You can view this as a massless, rigid rod.

```dart
final distanceJointDef = DistanceJointDef()
  ..initialize(firstBody, secondBody, firstBody.worldCenter, secondBody.worldCenter)
  ..length = 10
  ..frequencyHz = 3
  ..dampingRatio = 0.2;

world.createJoint(DistanceJoint(distanceJointDef));
```

```{flutter-app}
:sources: ../../examples
:page: distance_joint
:subfolder: stories/bridge_libraries/flame_forge2d/joints
:show: code popup
```

To create a `DistanceJointDef`, you can use the `initialize` method, which requires two bodies and a
world anchor point on each body. The definition uses local anchor points, allowing for a slight
violation of the constraint in the initial configuration. This is useful when saving and
loading a game.

The `DistanceJointDef` has three optional parameters that you can set:

- `length`: This parameter determines the distance between the two anchor points and must be greater
  than 0. The default value is 1.

- `frequencyHz`: This parameter sets the frequency of oscillation of the joint. If it is not set
  to 0, the higher the value, the less springy the joint becomes.

- `dampingRatio`: This parameter defines how quickly the oscillation comes to rest. It ranges from
  0 to 1, where 0 means no damping and 1 indicates critical damping.

```{warning}
Do not use a zero or short length.
```

### `FrictionJoint`

A `FrictionJoint` is used for simulating friction in a top-down game. It provides 2D translational
friction and angular friction.

The `FrictionJoint` isn't related to the friction that occurs when two shapes collide in the x-y plane
of the screen. Instead, it's designed to simulate friction along the z-axis, which is perpendicular
to the screen. The most common use-case for it is applying the friction force between a moving body
and the game floor.

The `initialize` method of the `FrictionJointDef` method requires two bodies that will have friction
force applied to them, and an anchor.

The third parameter is the `anchor` point in the world coordinates where the friction force will be
applied. In most cases, it would be the center of the first object. However, for more complex
physics interactions between bodies, you can set the `anchor` point to a specific location on one or
both of the bodies.

```dart
final frictionJointDef = FrictionJointDef()
  ..initialize(ballBody, floorBody, ballBody.worldCenter)
  ..maxForce = 50
  ..maxTorque = 50;

  world.createJoint(FrictionJoint(frictionJointDef));
```

```{flutter-app}
:sources: ../../examples
:page: friction_joint
:subfolder: stories/bridge_libraries/flame_forge2d/joints
:show: code popup
```

When creating a `FrictionJoint`, simulated friction can be applied via maximum force and torque
values:

- `maxForce`: the maximum translational friction which applied to the joined body. A higher value
- simulates higher friction.

- `maxTorque`: the maximum angular friction which may be applied to the joined body. A higher value
- simulates higher friction.

In other words, the former simulates the friction, when the body is sliding and the latter simulates
the friction when the body is spinning.

### `GearJoint`

The `GearJoint` is used to connect two joints together. Joints are required to be a
[`RevoluteJoint`](#revolutejoint) or a [`PrismaticJoint`](#prismaticjoint) in any combination.

```{warning}
The connected joints must attach a dynamic body to a static body.
The static body is expected to be a bodyA on those joints
```

```dart
final gearJointDef = GearJointDef()
  ..bodyA = firstJoint.bodyA
  ..bodyB = secondJoint.bodyA
  ..joint1 = firstJoint
  ..joint2 = secondJoint
  ..ratio = 1;

world.createJoint(GearJoint(gearJointDef));
```

```{flutter-app}
:sources: ../../examples
:page: gear_joint
:subfolder: stories/bridge_libraries/flame_forge2d/joints
:show: code popup
```

- `joint1`, `joint2`: Connected revolute or prismatic joints
- `bodyA`, `bodyB`: Any bodies form the connected joints, as long as they are not the same body.
- `ratio`: Gear ratio

Similarly to [`PulleyJoint`](#pulleyjoint), you can specify a gear ratio to bind the motions
together:

```text
coordinate1 + ratio * coordinate2 == constant
```

The ratio can be negative or positive. If one joint is a `RevoluteJoint` and the other joint is a
`PrismaticJoint`, then the ratio will have units of length or units of 1/length.

Since the `GearJoint` depends on two other joints, if these are destroyed, the `GearJoint` needs to
be destroyed as well.

```{warning}
Manually destroy the `GearJoint` if joint1 or joint2 is destroyed
```

### `MotorJoint`

A `MotorJoint` is used to control the relative motion between two bodies. A typical usage is to
control the movement of a dynamic body with respect to the fixed point, for example to create
animations.

A `MotorJoint` lets you control the motion of a body by specifying target position and rotation
offsets. You can set the maximum motor force and torque that will be applied to reach the target
position and rotation. If the body is blocked, it will stop and the contact forces will be
proportional the maximum motor force and torque.

```dart
final motorJointDef = MotorJointDef()
  ..initialize(first, second)
  ..maxTorque = 1000
  ..maxForce = 1000
  ..correctionFactor = 0.1;

  world.createJoint(MotorJoint(motorJointDef));
```

```{flutter-app}
:sources: ../../examples
:page: motor_joint
:subfolder: stories/bridge_libraries/flame_forge2d/joints
:show: code popup
```

A `MotorJointDef` has three optional parameters:

- `maxForce`: the maximum translational force which will be applied to the joined body to reach the
  target position.

- `maxTorque`: the maximum angular force which will be applied to the joined body to reach the
  target rotation.

- `correctionFactor`: position correction factor in range [0, 1]. It adjusts the joint's response to
  deviation from target position. A higher value makes the joint respond faster, while a lower value
  makes it respond slower. If the value is set too high, the joint may overcompensate and oscillate,
  becoming unstable. If set too low, it may respond too slowly.

The linear and angular offsets are the target distance and angle that the bodies should achieve
relative to each other's position and rotation. By default, the linear target will be the distance
between the two body centers and the angular target will be the relative rotation of the bodies.
Use the `setLinearOffset(Vector2)` and `setLinearOffset(double)` methods of the `MotorJoint` to set
the desired relative translation and rotate between the bodies.

For example, this code increments the angular offset of the joint every update cycle, causing the
body to rotate.

```dart
@override
void update(double dt) {
  super.update(dt);

  final angularOffset = joint.getAngularOffset() + motorSpeed * dt;
  joint.setAngularOffset(angularOffset);
}
```

### `MouseJoint`

The `MouseJoint` is used to manipulate bodies with the mouse. It attempts to drive a point on a body
towards the current position of the cursor. There is no restriction on rotation.

The `MouseJoint` definition has a target point, maximum force, frequency, and damping ratio. The
target point initially coincides with the body's anchor point. The maximum force is used to prevent
violent reactions when multiple dynamic bodies interact. You can make this as large as you like.
The frequency and damping ratio are used to create a spring/damper effect similar to the distance
joint.

```{warning}
Many users have tried to adapt the mouse joint for game play. Users often want
to achieve precise positioning and instantaneous response. The mouse joint
doesn't work very well in that context. You may wish to consider using
kinematic bodies instead.
```

```dart
final mouseJointDef = MouseJointDef()
  ..maxForce = 3000 * ballBody.mass * 10
  ..dampingRatio = 1
  ..frequencyHz = 5
  ..target.setFrom(ballBody.position)
  ..collideConnected = false
  ..bodyA = groundBody
  ..bodyB = ballBody;

  mouseJoint = MouseJoint(mouseJointDef);
  world.createJoint(mouseJoint);
}
```

```{flutter-app}
:sources: ../../examples
:page: mouse_joint
:subfolder: stories/bridge_libraries/flame_forge2d/joints
:show: code popup
```

- `maxForce`: This parameter defines the maximum constraint force that can be exerted to move the
  candidate body. Usually you will express as some multiple of the weight
  (multiplier _mass_ gravity).

- `dampingRatio`: This parameter defines how quickly the oscillation comes to rest. It ranges from
  0 to 1, where 0 means no damping and 1 indicates critical damping.

- `frequencyHz`: This parameter defines the response speed of the body, i.e. how quickly it tries to
  reach the target position

- `target`: The initial world target point. This is assumed to coincide with the body anchor
  initially.

### `PrismaticJoint`

The `PrismaticJoint` provides a single degree of freedom, allowing for a relative translation of two
bodies along an axis fixed in bodyA. Relative rotation is prevented.

`PrismaticJointDef` requires defining a line of motion using an axis and an anchor point.
The definition uses local anchor points and a local axis so that the initial configuration
can violate the constraint slightly.

The joint translation is zero when the local anchor points coincide in world space.
Using local anchors and a local axis helps when saving and loading a game.

```{warning}
At least one body should by dynamic with a non-fixed rotation.
```

The `PrismaticJoint` definition is similar to the [`RevoluteJoint`](#revolutejoint) definition, but
instead of rotation, it uses translation.

```dart
final prismaticJointDef = PrismaticJointDef()
  ..initialize(
    dynamicBody,
    groundBody,
    dynamicBody.worldCenter,
    Vector2(1, 0),
  )
```

```{flutter-app}
:sources: ../../examples
:page: prismatic_joint
:subfolder: stories/bridge_libraries/flame_forge2d/joints
:show: code popup
```

- `b1`, `b2`: Bodies connected by the joint.
- `anchor`: World anchor point, to put the axis through. Usually the center of the first body.
- `axis`: World translation axis, along which the translation will be fixed.

In some cases you might wish to control the range of motion. For this, the `PrismaticJointDef` has
optional parameters that allow you to simulate a joint limit and/or a motor.

#### Prismatic Joint Limit

You can limit the relative rotation with a joint limit that specifies a lower and upper translation.

```dart
jointDef
  ..enableLimit = true
  ..lowerTranslation = -20
  ..upperTranslation = 20;
```

- `enableLimit`: Set to true to enable translation limits
- `lowerTranslation`: The lower translation limit in meters
- `upperTranslation`: The upper translation limit in meters

You change the limits after the joint was created with this method:

```dart
prismaticJoint.setLimits(-10, 10);
```

#### Prismatic Joint Motor

You can use a motor to drive the motion or to model joint friction. A maximum motor force is
provided so that infinite forces are not generated.

```dart
jointDef
  ..enableMotor = true
  ..motorSpeed = 1
  ..maxMotorForce = 100;
```

- `enableMotor`: Set to true to enable the motor
- `motorSpeed`: The desired motor speed in radians per second
- `maxMotorForce`: The maximum motor torque used to achieve the desired motor speed in N-m.

You change the motor's speed and force after the joint was created using these methods:

```dart
prismaticJoint.setMotorSpeed(2);
prismaticJoint.setMaxMotorForce(200);
```

Also, you can get the joint angle and speed using the following methods:

```dart
prismaticJoint.getJointTranslation();
prismaticJoint.getJointSpeed();
```

### `PulleyJoint`

A `PulleyJoint` is used to create an idealized pulley. The pulley connects two bodies to the ground
and to each other. As one body goes up, the other goes down. The total length of the pulley rope is
conserved according to the initial configuration:

```text
length1 + length2 == constant
```

You can supply a ratio that simulates a block and tackle. This causes one side of the pulley to
extend faster than the other. At the same time the constraint force is smaller on one side than the
other. You can use this to create a mechanical leverage.

```text
length1 + ratio * length2 == constant
```

For example, if the ratio is 2, then `length1` will vary at twice the rate of `length2`. Also the
force in the rope attached to the first body will have half the constraint force as the rope
attached to the second body.

```dart
final pulleyJointDef = PulleyJointDef()
  ..initialize(
    firstBody,
    secondBody,
    firstPulley.worldCenter,
    secondPulley.worldCenter,
    firstBody.worldCenter,
    secondBody.worldCenter,
    1,
  );

world.createJoint(PulleyJoint(pulleyJointDef));
```

```{flutter-app}
:sources: ../../examples
:page: pulley_joint
:subfolder: stories/bridge_libraries/flame_forge2d/joints
:show: code popup
```

The `initialize` method of `PulleyJointDef` requires two ground anchors, two dynamic bodies and
their anchor points, and a pulley ratio.

- `b1`, `b2`: Two dynamic bodies connected with the joint
- `ga1`, `ga2`: Two ground anchors
- `anchor1`, `anchor2`: Anchors on the dynamic bodies the joint will be attached to
- `r`: Pulley ratio to simulate a block and tackle

`PulleyJoint` also provides the current lengths:

```dart
joint.getCurrentLengthA()
joint.getCurrentLengthB()
```

```{warning}
`PulleyJoint` can get a bit troublesome by itself. They often work better when
combined with prismatic joints. You should also cover the anchor points
with static shapes to prevent one side from going to zero length.
```

### `RevoluteJoint`

A `RevoluteJoint` forces two bodies to share a common anchor point, often called a hinge point.
The revolute joint has a single degree of freedom: the relative rotation of the two bodies.

To create a `RevoluteJoint`, provide two bodies and a common point to the `initialize` method.
The definition uses local anchor points so that the initial configuration can violate the
constraint slightly.

```dart
final jointDef = RevoluteJointDef()
  ..initialize(firstBody, secondBody, firstBody.position);
world.createJoint(RevoluteJoint(jointDef));
```

```{flutter-app}
:sources: ../../examples
:page: revolute_joint
:subfolder: stories/bridge_libraries/flame_forge2d/joints
:show: code popup
```

In some cases you might wish to control the joint angle. For this, the `RevoluteJointDef` has
optional parameters that allow you to simulate a joint limit and/or a motor.

#### Revolute Joint Limit

You can limit the relative rotation with a joint limit that specifies a lower and upper angle.

```dart
jointDef
  ..enableLimit = true
  ..lowerAngle = 0
  ..upperAngle = pi / 2;
```

- `enableLimit`: Set to true to enable angle limits
- `lowerAngle`: The lower angle in radians
- `upperAngle`: The upper angle in radians

You change the limits after the joint was created with this method:

```dart
revoluteJoint.setLimits(0, pi);
```

#### Revolute Joint Motor

You can use a motor to drive the relative rotation about the shared point. A maximum motor torque is
provided so that infinite forces are not generated.

```dart
jointDef
  ..enableMotor = true
  ..motorSpeed = 5
  ..maxMotorTorque = 100;
```

- `enableMotor`: Set to true to enable the motor
- `motorSpeed`: The desired motor speed in radians per second
- `maxMotorTorque`: The maximum motor torque used to achieve the desired motor speed in N-m.

You change the motor's speed and torque after the joint was created using these methods:

```dart
revoluteJoint.setMotorSpeed(2);
revoluteJoint.setMaxMotorTorque(200);
```

Also, you can get the joint angle and speed using the following methods:

```dart
revoluteJoint.jointAngle();
revoluteJoint.jointSpeed();
```

### `RopeJoint`

A `RopeJoint` restricts the maximum distance between two points on two bodies.

`RopeJointDef` requires two body anchor points and the maximum length.

```dart
final ropeJointDef = RopeJointDef()
  ..bodyA = firstBody
  ..localAnchorA.setFrom(firstBody.getLocalCenter())
  ..bodyB = secondBody
  ..localAnchorB.setFrom(secondBody.getLocalCenter())
  ..maxLength = (secondBody.worldCenter - firstBody.worldCenter).length;

world.createJoint(RopeJoint(ropeJointDef));
```

```{flutter-app}
:sources: ../../examples
:page: rope_joint
:subfolder: stories/bridge_libraries/flame_forge2d/joints
:show: code popup
```

- `bodyA`, `bodyB`: Connected bodies
- `localAnchorA`, `localAnchorB`: Optional parameter, anchor point relative to the body's origin.
- `maxLength`: The maximum length of the rope. This must be larger than `linearSlop`, or the joint
  will have no effect.

```{warning}
The joint assumes that the maximum length doesn't change during simulation.
See `DistanceJoint` if you want to dynamically control length.
```

### `WeldJoint`

A `WeldJoint` is used to restrict all relative motion between two bodies, effectively joining them
together.

`WeldJointDef` requires two bodies that will be connected, and a world anchor:

```dart
final weldJointDef = WeldJointDef()
  ..initialize(bodyA, bodyB, anchor);

world.createJoint(WeldJoint(weldJointDef));
```

```{flutter-app}
:sources: ../../examples
:page: weld_joint
:subfolder: stories/bridge_libraries/flame_forge2d/joints
:show: code popup
```

- `bodyA`, `bodyB`: Two bodies that will be connected

- `anchor`: Anchor point in world coordinates, at which two bodies will be welded together
  to 0, the higher the value, the less springy the joint becomes.

#### Breakable Bodies and WeldJoint

Since the Forge2D constraint solver is iterative, joints are somewhat flexible. This means that the
bodies connected by a WeldJoint may bend slightly. If you want to simulate a breakable body, it's
better to create a single body with multiple fixtures. When the body breaks, you can destroy a
fixture and recreate it on a new body instead of relying on a `WeldJoint`.

# FlameIsolate

The power of [integral_isolates](https://pub.dev/packages/integral_isolates) neatly packaged in
[flame_isolate](https://pub.dev/packages/flame_isolate) for your Flame game.

If you've ever used the [compute](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/foundation/compute-constant.html)
function before, you will feel right at home. This mixin allows you to run CPU-intensive code in an
isolate.

To use it in your game you just need to add `flame_isolate` to your pubspec.yaml.

## Usage

Just add the mixin `FlameIsolate` to your component and start utilizing the power of an isolate as
simple as running the [compute](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/foundation/compute-constant.html)
function.

Example:

```dart
class MyGame extends FlameGame with FlameIsolate {
  ...
  @override
  void update(double dt) {
    if (shouldRecalculate) {
      isolate(recalculateWorld, worldData).then(updateWorld);
    }
    ...
  }
  ...
}
```

### Performance note

Keep in mind that every component with `FlameIsolate` mixin that you create and add to your game
will create a new isolate. This means you will probably want to create a manager component to
manage a lot of "dumber" components. Think of it like ants, where the queen controls the worker
ants. If every individual worker ant got its own isolate, it would be a total waste of power,
hence you would put it on the queen, which in turn tells all the worker ants what to do.

A simple example of this can be found in the example application for the FlameIsolate package.

### Backpressure Strategies

Backpressure strategies are a way to cope with the job queue when job items are produced more
rapidly than the isolate can handle them. This presents the problem of what to do with such a
growing backlog of unhandled jobs. To mitigate this problem this library funnels all jobs through a
job queue handler. Also known as `BackpressureStrategy`.

The ones currently supported are:

- `NoBackPressureStrategy` that basically does not handle back pressure. It uses a FIFO stack for
  storing a backlog of unhandled jobs. -`ReplaceBackpressureStrategy` that has a job queue with size one, and discards the queue upon
  adding a new job.
- `DiscardNewBackPressureStrategy` that has a job queue with size one, and as long as the queue is
  populated a new job will not be added.

You can specify a backpressure strategy by overriding the `backpressureStrategy` field. This will
create the isolate with the specified strategy when the component is mounted.

```dart
class MyGame extends FlameGame with FlameIsolate {
  @override
  BackpressureStrategy get backpressureStrategy => ReplaceBackpressureStrategy();
  ...
}
```

# flame_lottie

This package allows you to load and add Lottie animations to your Flame game.

The native Lottie libraries (such as [lottie-android](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android))
are maintained by **Airbnb**.

The Flutter package `lottie`, on which this wrapper is based on, is by developed **xaha.dev** and
can be found on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/lottie).

## Usage

To use it in your game you just need to add `flame_lottie` to your pubspec.yaml.

Simply load the Lottie animation using the **loadLottie** method and
the [LottieBuilder](https://pub.dev/documentation/lottie/latest/lottie/LottieBuilder-class.html).
It allows all the various ways of loading a Lottie file:

- [Lottie.asset](https://pub.dev/documentation/lottie/latest/lottie/Lottie/asset.html), for
  obtaining a Lottie file from an AssetBundle using a key.
- [Lottie.network](https://pub.dev/documentation/lottie/latest/lottie/Lottie/network.html), for
  obtaining a lottie file from a URL.
- [Lottie.file](https://pub.dev/documentation/lottie/latest/lottie/Lottie/file.html), for obtaining
  a lottie file from a File.
- [Lottie.memory](https://pub.dev/documentation/lottie/latest/lottie/Lottie/memory.html), for
  obtaining a lottie file from a Uint8List.

... and add it as `LottieComponent` to your Flame 🔥 game.

Example:

```dart
class MyGame extends FlameGame {
  ...
  @override
  Future<void> onLoad() async {
    final asset = Lottie.asset('assets/LottieLogo1.json');
    final animation = await loadLottie(asset);
    add(
      LottieComponent(
        animation,
        repeating: true, // Continuously loop the animation.
        size: Vector2.all(400),
      ),
    );
  }
  ...
}

# FlameNetworkAssets

`FlameNetworkAssets` is a bridge package focused on providing a solution to fetch, and cache assets
from the network.

The `FlameNetworkAssets` class provides an abstraction that should be extended in order to create
asset specific handler.

By default, the package relies on the `http` package to make http requests, and `path_provider`
to get the place to store the local cache, to use a different approach for those, use the
optional arguments in the constructor.

This package bundles a specific asset handler class for images:

```dart
final networkAssets = FlameNetworkImages();
final playerSprite = await networkAssets.load('https://url.com/image.png');
```

To create a specific asset handler class, you just need to extend the `FlameNetworkAssets` class
and define the `decodeAsset` and `encodeAsset` arguments:

```dart
class FlameNetworkCustomAsset extends FlameNetworkAssets<CustomAsset> {
  FlameNetworkImages({
    super.get,
    super.getAppDirectory,
    super.cacheInMemory,
    super.cacheInStorage,
  }) : super(
          decodeAsset: (bytes) => CustomAsset.decode(bytes),
          encodeAsset: (CustomAsset asset) => asset.encode(),
        );
}
```

# flame_rive

`flame_rive` is a bridge library for using [rive](https://rive.app/) animations in your Flame game.
Rive is a real-time interactive design and animation tool and you use it to create animations.

To use a file created by Rive in your game you need to add `flame_rive` to your pubspec.yaml, as can
be seen in the
[Flame Rive example](https://github.com/flame-engine/flame/tree/main/packages/flame_rive/example)
and in the pub.dev [installation instructions](https://pub.dev/packages/flame_rive).

## How to use it

First, start with adding the `animation.riv` file to the assets folder. Then load the artboard of
the animation to the game using the `loadArtboard` method. After that, create the
`StateMachine` from the artboard and pass it to the `RiveComponent`. The component will
automatically advance the state machine for you.

Interactivity should be handled via [Data Binding](https://rive.app/docs/runtimes/data-binding)
instead of state machine inputs, as they are deprecated in Rive 0.14.x.

```{flutter-app}
:sources: ../flame/examples
:page: rive_example
:show: widget code infobox
:width: 200
:height: 200
```

```dart
class RiveExampleGame extends FlameGame {
  @override
  Future<void> onLoad() async {
    final file = await File.asset(
      'assets/rewards.riv',
      riveFactory: Factory.rive,
    );

    final artboard = await loadArtboard(file!);
    final stateMachine = artboard.defaultStateMachine();

    if (stateMachine != null) {
      final viewModel = file.defaultArtboardViewModel(artboard);
      if (viewModel != null) {
        final viewModelInstance = viewModel.createDefaultInstance();
        if (viewModelInstance != null) {
          stateMachine.bindViewModelInstance(viewModelInstance);
          final coinAmount =
              viewModelInstance.viewModel('Coin')?.number('Item_Value');
          coinAmount?.value = 100;
        }
      }
    }

    add(
      RiveComponent(
        artboard: artboard,
        stateMachine: stateMachine,
        size: Vector2.all(550),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

You can use the state machine to manage the state of animation via data binding.
Check out the example for more information.

## File: bridge_packages/flame_riverpod/component.md

# Component

## ComponentRef

`ComponentRef` exposes Riverpod functionality to individual `Component`s, and is comparable to
`flutter_riverpod`'s `WidgetRef`.

## RiverpodComponentMixin

`RiverpodComponentMixin` manages the lifecycle of listeners on behalf of individual `Component`s.

`Component`s using this mixin must use `addToGameWidgetBuild` in their `onMount` method to add
listeners (e.g. `ref.watch` or `ref.listen`) _prior to_ calling `super.onMount`, which manages the
staged listeners and disposes of them on the user's behalf inside `onRemove`.

```dart

class RiverpodAwareTextComponent extends PositionComponent
    with RiverpodComponentMixin {
  late TextComponent textComponent;
  int currentValue = 0;

  @override
  void onMount() {
    addToGameWidgetBuild(() {
      ref.listen(countingStreamProvider, (p0, p1) {
        if (p1.hasValue) {
          currentValue = p1.value!;
          textComponent.text = '$currentValue';
        }
      });
    });
    super.onMount();
    add(textComponent = TextComponent(position: position + Vector2(0, 27)));
  }
}

```

## RiverpodGameMixin

`RiverpodGameMixin` provides listeners from all components to the build method of the
`RiverpodAwareGameWidget`.
The `addToGameWidgetBuild` method is available in the `RiverpodGameMixin` as well,
enabling you to access `ComponentRef` methods directly in your Game class.

# flame_riverpod

## Riverpod

[Riverpod](https://riverpod.dev/) is a reactive caching and data-binding
framework for Dart & Flutter.

In `flutter_riverpod`, widgets can be configured to rebuild when the state
of a provider changes.

When using Flame, we are interacting with components, which are _not_ Widgets.

`flame_riverpod` provides the `RiverpodAwareGameWidget`, `RiverpodGameMixin`, and
`RiverpodComponentMixin` to facilitate managing state from `Provider`s in your Flame Game.

## Usage

You should use the `RiverpodAwareGameWidget` as your Flame `GameWidget`, the `RiverpodGameMixin`
mixin on your game that extends `FlameGame`, and the `RiverpodComponentMixin` on any components
interacting with Riverpod providers.

Subscriptions to a provider are managed in accordance with the lifecycle
of a Flame Component: initialization occurs when a Component is mounted, and disposal
occurs when a Component is removed.

By default, the `RiverpodAwareGameWidget` is rebuilt when
Riverpod-aware (i.e. using the `RiverpodComponentMixin`) components are mounted and when they are
removed.

```dart
/// An excerpt from the Example. Check it out!
class RefExampleGame extends FlameGame with RiverpodGameMixin {
  @override
  Future<void> onLoad() async {
    await super.onLoad();
    add(TextComponent(text: 'Flame'));
    add(RiverpodAwareTextComponent());
  }
}

class RiverpodAwareTextComponent extends PositionComponent
    with RiverpodComponentMixin {
  late TextComponent textComponent;
  int currentValue = 0;

  @override
  void onMount() {
    addToGameWidgetBuild(() {
      ref.listen(countingStreamProvider, (p0, p1) {
        if (p1.hasValue) {
          currentValue = p1.value!;
          textComponent.text = '$currentValue';
        }
      });
    });
    super.onMount();
    add(textComponent = TextComponent(position: position + Vector2(0, 27)));
  }
}

```

The order of operations in `Component.onMount` is important. The `RiverpodComponentMixin`
interacts with `RiverpodGameMixin` (inside of `RiverpodComponentMixin.onMount`) to co-ordinate
adding and removing listeners as the corresponding component is mounted and removed, respectively.

## File: bridge_packages/flame_riverpod/widget.md

---

# Widget

## RiverpodAwareGameWidget

`RiverpodAwareGameWidget` is a GameWidget with a `State` object of type
`RiverpodAwareGameWidgetState`.

The required `GlobalKey` argument is used to provide `Component`s using `RiverpodComponentMixin`
access to `Provider`s via `RiverpodAwareGameWidgetState`.

## RiverpodAwareGameWidgetState

`RiverpodAwareGameWidgetState` performs the duties associated with the
`ConsumerStatefulElement` in `flutter_riverpod` and `GameWidgetState` in `flame`.

## File: bridge_packages/flame_spine/flame_spine.md

---

# flame_spine

This package allows you to load and add Spine skeletal animations to your Flame game.

## Usage

To use it in your game you just need to add `flame_spine` to your pubspec.yaml and your spine
assets to your `assets/` directory, and you can add a `SpineComponent` to your `FlameGame`.

```{note}
Remember to call `await initSpineFlutter();` in your `main` method, or in `onLoad`.
```

Example:

```dart
void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  await initSpineFlutter();
  runApp(const GameWidget.controlled(gameFactory: SpineExample.new));
}

class FlameSpineExample extends FlameGame {
 late final SpineComponent spineboy;

 @override
 Future<void> onLoad() async {
  await initSpineFlutter();
  // Load the Spineboy atlas and skeleton data from asset files
  // and create a SpineComponent from them, scaled down and
  // centered on the screen
  spineboy = await SpineComponent.fromAssets(
   atlasFile: 'assets/spine/spineboy.atlas',
   skeletonFile: 'assets/spine/spineboy-pro.skel',
   scale: Vector2(0.4, 0.4),
   anchor: Anchor.center,
   position: size / 2,
  );

  // Set the "walk" animation on track 0 in looping mode
  spineboy.animationState.setAnimationByName(0, 'walk', true);
  await add(spineboy);
 }

 @override
 void onDetach() {
  // Dispose the native resources that have been loaded for spineboy.
  spineboy.dispose();
 }
}
```

# Flame SVG

flame_svg provides a simple API for rendering SVG images in your game.

## Installation

Svg support is provided by the `flame_svg` bridge package, be sure to put it in your pubspec file
to use it.

If you want to know more about the installation visit
[flame_svg on pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flame_svg/install).

## How to use flame_svg

To use it just import the `Svg` class from `'package:flame_svg/flame_svg.dart'`, and use the
following snippet to render it on the canvas:

```dart
final svgInstance = await Svg.load('android.svg');

final position = Vector2(100, 100);
final size = Vector2(300, 300);

svgInstance.renderPosition(canvas, position, size);
```

or use the `SvgComponent` and add it to the component tree:

```dart
class MyGame extends FlameGame {
  @override
  Future<void> onLoad() async {
    final svgInstance = await Svg.load('android.svg');
    final size = Vector2.all(100);
    final position = Vector2.all(100);
    final svgComponent = SvgComponent(
      size: size,
      position: position,
      svg: svgInstance,
    );

    add(svgComponent);
  }
}
```

# flame_texturepacker

**flame_texturepacker**
is a bridge package that allows you to load sprite sheets generated by [CodeAndWeb's TexturePacker]
into your Flame game.

A sprite sheet (or texture atlas) is a larger image that packs many smaller sprites together.
This reduces the number of separate textures a game must load, which lowers overhead
and can improve loading speed and rendering performance.

## Installation

Add _flame_texturepacker_ to your project:

```shell
flutter pub add flame_texturepacker
```

Then import it in your Dart code:

```dart
import 'package:flame_texturepacker/flame_texturepacker.dart';
```

## Usage

### Loading from Assets

First, add your `.atlas` data file and sprite sheet images to your assets directory and reference
them in your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
flutter:
  assets:
    - assets/images/atlas_map.atlas
    - assets/images/sprite_sheet1.png
    - assets/images/sprite_sheet2.png
    - assets/images/sprite_sheet3.png
```

Then load the atlas in your game:

```dart
class MyGame extends FlameGame {
  @override
  Future<void> onLoad() async {
    // Load the texture atlas
    final atlas = await atlasFromAssets('atlas_map.atlas');

    // Use the atlas to get sprites
    final sprite = atlas.findSpriteByName('robot_jump')!;
    add(SpriteComponent(sprite: sprite));
  }
}
```

## TexturePackerAtlas

The `TexturePackerAtlas` class is the main interface for working with texture atlases. It provides
several methods to query and retrieve sprites.

### Finding Sprites

**Find a single sprite by name:**

```dart
final jumpSprite = atlas.findSpriteByName('robot_jump')!;
final fallSprite = atlas.findSpriteByName('robot_fall')!;
```

**Find a sprite by name and index:**

```dart
final sprite = atlas.findSpriteByNameIndex('robot_walk', 0);
```

**Find all sprites with the same name:**

This is particularly useful for creating animations from indexed sprites:

```dart
// Get all sprites with the name 'robot_walk'
// (e.g., robot_walk_0, robot_walk_1, etc.)
final walkingSprites = atlas.findSpritesByName('robot_walk');

// Create an animation from the sprite list
final walkingAnimation = SpriteAnimation.spriteList(
  walkingSprites,
  stepTime: 0.1,
  loop: true,
);

add(SpriteAnimationComponent(animation: walkingAnimation));
```

## Advanced Options

### Whitelist Filtering

To optimize memory usage, you can specify a whitelist of sprite names to load. Only sprites whose
names contain any of the whitelist strings will be loaded:

```dart
final atlas = await TexturePackerAtlas.load(
  'atlas_map.atlas',
  whiteList: [ 'robot_walk' ]
);
```

This is particularly useful for large atlases where you only need a subset of sprites.

### Original Size vs Packed Size

TexturePacker can trim transparent pixels from sprites to save space. By default,
`flame_texturepacker` uses the original (untrimmed) size. You can change this behavior:

```dart
final atlas = await TexturePackerAtlas.load(
  'atlas_map.atlas',
  useOriginalSize: false, // Use the trimmed/packed size instead
);
```

### Custom Asset Prefix

If your `.atlas` data file is not stored in the default `images` directory:

```dart
final atlas = await atlasFromAssets(
  'atlas_map.atlas',
  assetsPrefix: 'custom_path',
);
```

# flame_tiled

**flame_tiled** is the bridge package that connects the flame game engine to [Tiled] maps by parsing
TMX (XML) files and accessing the tiles, objects, and everything in there.

To use this,

1. Create your own map by using [Tiled].
2. Create a `TiledComponent` and add it to the component tree as follows:

```dart
final component = await TiledComponent.load(
  'my_map.tmx',
  Vector2.all(32),
);

add(component);
```

## TiledComponent

Tiled is a free and open source, full-featured level and map editor for your platformer or
RPG game. Currently we have an "in progress" implementation of a Tiled component. This API
uses the lib [tiled.dart](https://github.com/flame-engine/tiled.dart) to parse map files and
render visible layers using the performant `SpriteBatch` for each layer.

Supported map types include: Orthogonal, Isometric, Hexagonal, and Staggered.

|                           Orthogonal                            |                            Hexagonal                             |                                Isomorphic                                |
| :-------------------------------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| ![An example of an orthogonal map](../../images/orthogonal.png) | ![An example of hexagonal map](../../images/pointy_hex_even.png) | ![An example of isomorphic map](../../images/tile_stack_single_move.png) |

An example of how to use the API can be found
[here](https://github.com/flame-engine/flame/tree/main/packages/flame_tiled/example).

### TileStack

Once a `TiledComponent` is loaded, you can select any column of (x,y) tiles in a `tileStack` to
then add animation. Removing the stack will not remove the tiles from the map.

> **Note**: This currently only supports position based effects.

```dart
void onLoad() {
  final stack = map.tileMap.tileStack(4, 0, named: {'floor_under'});
  stack.add(
    SequenceEffect(
      [
        MoveEffect.by(
          Vector2(5, 0),
          NoiseEffectController(duration: 1, frequency: 20),
        ),
        MoveEffect.by(Vector2.zero(), LinearEffectController(2)),
      ],
      repeatCount: 3,
    )
      ..onComplete = () => stack.removeFromParent(),
  );
  map.add(stack);
}
```

### TileAtlas

When a tilemap has multiple images (from multiple tilesets) `TiledComponent` uses a `TileAtlas` to
pack all those image into a single big image (a.k.a atlas). This helps in rendering the whole map in
a single draw call. But is there a limit on how big this atlas can be based on the target platform
and hardware. As it is not possible to query this max size from Flame or Flutter as of now,
`TiledComponent` limits the atlas to `4096x4096` for web and `8192x8192` for all other platforms.

These limits should work well for most cases. But in case you are sure that your target platform can
support bigger atlas and want to override the limits used by `TiledComponent` you can do so by
passing in the `atlasMaxX` and `atlasMaxX` values to `TiledComponent.load`.

NOTE: This is not recommended as such huge sizes might not work with all hardware. Instead consider
resizing the original tileset images so that when packed they fit with the limits.

```dart
final component = await TiledComponent.load(
  'my_map.tmx',
  Vector2.all(32),
  atlasMaxX: 9216,
  atlasMaxY: 9216,
);

add(component);
```

## Limitations

### Flip

[Tiled] has a feature that allows you to flip a tile horizontally or vertically, or even rotate it.

`flame_tiled` supports this but if you are using a large texture and have flipped tiles there will
be a drop in performance. If you want to ignore any flips in your tilemap you can set the
`ignoreFlip` to false in the constructor.

**Note**: A large texture in this context means one with multiple tilesets (or a huge tileset)
where the sum of their dimensions are in the thousands.

```dart
final component = await TiledComponent.load(
  'my_map.tmx',
  Vector2.all(32),
  ignoreFlip: true,
);
```

### Clearing images cache

If you have called `Flame.images.clearCache()` you also need to call `TiledAtlas.clearCache()` to
remove disposed images from the tiled cache. It might be useful if your next game map have completely
different tiles than the previous.

[Tiled]: https://www.mapeditor.org/

## Troubleshooting

### My game shows "lines" and artifacts between the map tiles

This is caused by the imprecision found in float-pointing numbers in computer science.

Check this [Article](https://verygood.ventures/blog/solving-super-dashs-rendering-challenges-eliminating-ghost-lines-for-a-seamless-gaming-experience)
to learn more about the issue and how it can be solved.

```{toctree}
:hidden:

Tiled  <tiled.md>
Layers <layers.md>
```

---

## File: bridge_packages/flame_tiled/layers.md

---

# Layers

At its simplest, layers can be retrieved from a Tilemap by invoking:

```dart
getLayer<ObjectGroup>("myObjectGroupLayer");
getLayer<ImageLayer>("myImageLayer");
getLayer<TileLayer>("myTileLayer");
getLayer<Group>("myGroupLayer");
```

These methods will either return the requested layer type or null if it does not exist.

## Layer properties

The following Tiled properties are supported:

- [x] Visible
- [x] Opacity
- [ ] Tint color
- [x] Horizontal offset
- [x] Vertical offset
- [x] Parallax factor
- [x] Custom properties

## Tiles properties

- Tiles can have custom properties accessible at `tile.properties`.
- Tiles can have a custom `type` (or `class` starting in Tiled v1.9) accessible at `tile.type`.

## Other features

Other advanced features are not yet supported, but you can easily read the objects and other
features of the TMX and add custom behavior (eg regions for triggers and walking areas, custom
animated objects).

## Full Example

You can check a working example
[here](https://github.com/flame-engine/flame/tree/main/packages/flame_tiled/example).

# Tiled

[Tiled] is a great tool to design levels and maps. From [Tiled]'s documentation:

> Tiled is a 2D level editor that helps you develop the content of your game. Its
> primary feature is to edit tile maps of various forms, but it also supports
> free image placement as well as powerful ways to annotate your level with extra
> information used by the game. Tiled focuses on general flexibility while trying
> to stay intuitive.
>
> In terms of tile maps, it supports straight rectangular tile layers, but also
> projected isometric, staggered isometric and staggered hexagonal layers. A
> tileset can be either a single image containing many tiles, or it can be a
> collection of individual images. In order to support certain depth faking
> techniques, tiles and layers can be offset by a custom distance and their
> rendering order can be configured.

![Tiled Editor](../../images/TiledEditor.jpg)

Flame provides a package ([flame_tiled]) that bundles a [dart] package which allows you to parse TMX
(XML) files and access the tiles, objects, and everything in there.

The [dart] package provides a simple `Tiled` class and [flame_tiled] provides a component wrapper
`TiledComponent`, for the map rendering, which renders the tiles on the screen and supports
rotations and flips.

## Tiled Editor

You can choose to download the [Tiled] map editor and create interactive maps that can be loaded
into your game. At its core, the [Tiled] map editor creates a TMX file that can be parsed and used
within your game.

First Topic    <relative_path/to_topic1.md>
Second Topic   <topic2.md>
```
````

When adding new documents into the documentation site, make sure that they are mentioned in one of
the toctrees -- otherwise you will see a warning during the build that the document is orphaned.

## Admonitions

Admonitions are emphasized blocks of text with a distinct appearance. They are created using the
triple-backticks syntax:

````markdown
```{note}
Please note this very important caveat.
```

```{warning}
Don't look down, or you will encounter an error.
```

```{error}
I told you so.
```

```{seealso}
Also check out this cool thingy.
```
````

```{note}
Please note this very important caveat.
```

```{warning}
Don't look down, or you will encounter an error.
```

```{error}
I told you so.
```

```{seealso}
Also check out this cool thingy.
```

## Deprecations

The special `{deprecated}` block can be used to mark some part of documentation or syntax as being
deprecated. This block requires specifying the version when the deprecation has occurred

````markdown
```{deprecated} v1.3.0

Please use this **other** thing instead.
```
````

Which would be rendered like this:

```{deprecated} v1.3.0

Please use this **other** thing instead.
```

## Live examples

Our documentation site includes a custom-built **flutter-app** directive which allows creating
Flutter widgets and embedding them alongside the overall documentation content.

In Markdown, the code for inserting an embed looks like this:

````markdown
```{flutter-app}
:sources: ../flame/examples
:page: tap_events
:show: widget code popup
:width: 180
:height: 160
```
````

Here's what the different options mean:

- **sources**: specifies the name of the root directory where the Flutter code that you wish to run
  is located. This directory must be a Flutter repository, and there must be a `pubspec.yaml` file
  there. The path is considered relative to the `doc/_sphinx` directory.

- **page**: a sub-path within the root directory given in `sources`. This option has two effects:
  first, it is appended to the path of the html page of the widget, like so: `main.dart.html?$page`.
  Secondly, the button to show the source code of the embed will display the code from the file or
  directory with the name given by `page`.

  The purpose of this option is to be able to bundle multiple examples into a single executable.
  When using this option, the `main.dart` file of the app should route the execution to the proper
  widget according to the `page` being passed.

- **show**: contains a subset of modes: `widget`, `code`, `infobox`, and `popup`. The `widget` mode
  creates an iframe with the embedded example, directly within the page. The `code` mode will show
  a button that allows the user to see the code that produced this example. The `popup` mode also
  shows a button, which displays the example in an overlay window. This is more suitable for
  demoing larger apps. Using both "widget" and "popup" modes at the same time is not recommended.
  Finally, the `infobox` mode will display the result in a floating window -- this mode is best
  combined with `widget` and `code`.

- **width**: an integer that defines the width of the embedded application. If this is not defined,
  the width will be 100%.

- **height**: an integer that defines the height of the embedded application. If this is not
  defined, the height will be 350px.

```{flutter-app}
:sources: ../flame/examples
:page: tap_events
:show: widget code popup
```

## Standardization and Templates

For every section or package added to the documentation, naming conventions, directory structure,
and standardized table of contents are important. Every section and package must have a table of
contents or an entry in the parent markdown file to allow navigation from the left sidebar menu in
logical or alphabetical order. Additionally, naming conventions should be followed for organization,
such as:

- bridge_packages/package_name/package_name.md
- documentation_section/documentation_section.md

```{note}
Avoid having spaces in the paths to the docs since that will keep you from
building the project due to
[this bug](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/13765).
```

## Building documentation locally

Building the documentation site on your own computer is fairly simple. All you need is the
following:

1. A working **Flutter** installation, accessible from the command line.

2. **Melos** command-line tool, as per the [contributing] guide.

3. A **Python** environment, with python version 3.8+ or higher. Having a dedicated python
   virtual environment is recommended but not required.

4. Install the remaining requirements using the command

   ```shell
   melos run doc-setup
   ```

Once these prerequisites are met, you can build the documentation by using the built-in Melos
target:

```shell
melos doc-build
```

The **melos doc-build** command here renders the documentation site into HTML. This command needs to
be re-run every time you make changes to any of the documents. Luckily, it is smart enough to only
rebuild the documents that have changed since the previous run, so usually, a rebuild takes only a
second or two.

If you want to automatically recompile the docs every time there is a change to one of the files
you can use the built-in Melos target below, which will also serve and open your default
browser with the docs.

```shell
melos doc-serve
```

When using the **melos doc-serve** command, the **melos doc-build** is only needed when
there are changes to the sphinx theme. This is because the serve command both automatically
compiles the docs on changes and also hosts them locally. The docs are served at
`http://localhost:8000/` by default.

There are other make commands that you may find occasionally useful too:

- **melos doc-clean** removes all cached generated files (in case the system gets stuck in a bad
  state).
- **melos doc-linkcheck** to check whether there are any broken links in the documentation.
- **melos doc-kill** removes any orphaned TCP threads running on port 8000.

The generated html files will be in the `doc/_build/html` directory, you can view them directly
by opening the file `doc/_build/html/index.html` in your browser. The only drawback is that the
browser won't allow any dynamic content in a file opened from a local drive. The solution to this
is to run **melos doc-serve**.

If you ever run the **melos doc-clean** command, the server will need to be restarted, because the
clean command deletes the entire `html` directory.

```{note}
Avoid having spaces in the paths to the docs since that will keep you from
building the project due to
[this bug](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/13765).

# Flame Style Guide

This is a general style guide for writing code within Flame and adjacent projects. We strive to
maintain the code clean and readable -- both for the benefit of the users who will need to study
this code in order to understand how a particular feature works or debug something that is breaking,
and for the benefit of the current and future maintainers.

This guide extends upon the official [Dart's style guide][effective dart]. Please make sure to read
that document first, as it is sure to improve your skill in Dart programming.

## Code Formatting

Most of the code formatting rules are enforced automatically via the linter. Run the following
commands to ensure the code is conformant and to fix any easy formatting problems:

```shell
flutter analyze
dart format .
```

## Code Structure

### Imports

- If you're using an external symbol that's defined in multiple libraries, prefer importing the
  smallest of them. For example, use `package:meta/meta.dart` to import annotations like
  `@protected`, or `dart:ui` to import `Canvas`.

- Never import `package:flutter/cupertino.dart` or `package:flutter/material.dart` -- prefer
  a much smaller library `package:flutter/widgets.dart` if you're working with widgets.

### Exports

- Strongly prefer to have only one public class per file, and name the file after that class.
  Having several private classes within the file is perfectly reasonable.

- A possible exception to this rule is if the "main" class requires some small "helper" classes
  that need to be public. Or if the file hosts multiple very small related classes.

- The "main" class in a file should be located at the start of the file (right after the imports
  section), so that it can be seen immediately upon opening the file. All other definitions,
  including typedefs, helper classes and functions, should be moved below the main class.

- If multiple public symbols are defined in a file, then they must be exported explicitly using
  the `export ... show ...` statement. For example:

  ```dart
  export 'src/effects/provider_interfaces.dart'
    show
      AnchorProvider,
      AngleProvider,
      PositionProvider,
      ScaleProvider,
      SizeProvider;
  ```

### Assertions

Use `assert`s to detect contract violations, or pre-condition/post-condition failures. Sometimes,
however, using exceptions would be more appropriate. The following rules of thumb apply:

- Use an assert with a clear error message to check for a condition that is in developers' control.
  For example, when creating a component that takes an `opacity` level as an input, you should check
  whether the value is in the range from 0 to 1. Consider also including the value itself into the
  error message, to make it easier for the developer to debug the error:

  ```dart
  assert(0 <= opacity && opacity <= 1, 'The opacity value must be from 0 to 1: $opacity');
  ```

  Always use asserts as early as possible to detect possible violations. For example, check the
  validity of `opacity` in the constructor/setter, instead of in the render function.

  When adding such an assert, also include a test that checks that the assert triggers. This test
  would verify that the component does not accept invalid input, and that the error message is what
  you expect it to be.

- Use an assert without an error message to check for a condition that cannot be triggered by the
  developer through any means known to you. If such an assert does trigger, it would indicate a bug
  in the Flame framework.

  Such asserts serve as "mini-tests" directly in the code, and protect against future refactorings
  that could create an erroneous internal state. It should not be possible to write a test that
  would deliberately trigger such an assert.

- Use an explicit if-check with an exception to test for a condition that may be outside of the
  developer's control (i.e. it may depend on the environment or on user's input). When deciding
  whether to use an assert or exception, consider the following question: is it possible for the
  error condition to occur in production even after the developer has done extensive testing on
  their side?

### Class structure

- Consider putting all class constructors at the top of the class. This makes it much easier to see
  how the class ought to be used.

- Try to make as much of your class' API private as possible, do not expose members "just in case".
  This makes it much easier to modify/refactor the class later without it being a breaking change.

  Remember to document all your public members! Documenting things is harder than it looks, and one
  way to avoid the burden of documentation is to make as many variables private as possible.

- If a class exposes a `List<X>` or `Vector2` property -- it is **NOT** an invitation to modify
  them at will! Consider such properties as read-only, unless the documentation explicitly says that
  they are allowed to be modified.

- When a class becomes sufficiently big, consider adding _regions_ inside it, which help with code
  navigation and collapsing (note the lack of space after `//`):

  ```dart
  //#region Region description
  ...
  //#endregion
  ```

- If a class has a private member that needs to be exposed via a getter/setter, prefer the following
  code structure:

  ```dart
  class MyClass {
    MyClass();

    ...
    int _variable;
    ...

    /// Docs for both the getter and the setter.
    int get variable => _variable;
    set variable(int value) {
      assert(value >= 0, 'variable must be non-negative: $value');
      _variable = value;
    }
  }
  ```

  This would gather all private variables in a single block near the top of the class, allowing one
  to quickly see what data the class has.

## Documentation

- Use dartdocs `///` to explain the meaning/purpose of a class, method, or a variable.

- Use regular comments `//` to explain implementation details of a particular code fragment. That
  is, these comments explain HOW something works.

- Use markdown documentation in `doc/` folder to give the high-level overview of the functionality,
  and especially how it fits into the overall Flame framework.

### Dartdocs

- Check the [Flutter Documentation Guide] -- it contains lots of great advice on writing good
  documentation.
  - However, disregard the advice about writing in a passive voice.

- Class documentation should ideally start with the class name itself, and follow a pattern such as:

  ```dart
  /// [MyClass] is ...
  /// [MyClass] serves as ...
  /// [MyClass] does the following ...
  ```

  The reason for such convention is that often the documentation for a class becomes sufficiently
  long, and it may not be immediately apparent when looking at the top of the doc what exactly is
  being documented there.

- Method documentation should start with a verb in the present simple tense, with the method name
  as an implicit subject. Add a paragraph break after the first sentence. Try to think about what
  could be unclear to the users of the method; and mention any pre- and post-conditions.
  For example:

  ```dart
  /// Adds a new [child] into the container, and becomes the owner of that
  /// child.
  ///
  /// The child will be disposed of when this container is destroyed.
  /// It is an error to try to add a child that already belongs to another
  /// container.
  void addChild(T child) { ... }
  ```

  Avoid stating the obvious (or at least only the obvious).

- Constructor documentation may follow either the style of a method (i.e. "Creates ...",
  "Constructs ..."), or of the class but omitting the name of the class (i.e. "Rectangular-shaped
  component"). Constructor documentation may be omitted if (1) it's the main constructor of the
  class, and (2) all the parameters are obvious and coincide with the public members of the class.

  **Do not** use macros to copy the class documentation into the constructor's dartdoc. Generally,
  the class documentation answers the question "what the class is", whereas the constructor docs
  answer "how it will be constructed".

### Main docs

This refers to the docs on the main Flame Documentation website, the one you're reading right now.
The main documentation site serves as a place where people go to learn about various functionality
available in Flame. If you're adding a new class, then it must be documented both at the dartdocs
level, and on the main docs site. The latter serves the purposes of discoverability of your class.
Without the docs site, your class might never be used (or at least used less than it could have
been), because the developers would simply not know about it.

When adding the documentation to the main docs site, consider also including an example directly
into the docs. This will make readers more excited about trying this new functionality.

Check the [Documentation] manual about how to work with the docs site.

The following style rules generally apply when writing documentation:

- Maximum line length of 100 characters;
- Prefer to define external links at the bottom of the document, so as to make reading the plain
  text of the document easier;
- Separate headers from the preceding content with 2 blank lines -- this makes it easier to see the
  sections within the plain text.
- Lists should start at the beginning of the line and sublists should be indented with 2 spaces.

# Writing tests

- All new functionality must be tested, if at all possible. When fixing a bug, tests must be added
  to ensure that this bug would not reappear in the future.

- Run `melos run coverage` to execute all tests in the "coverage" mode. The results will be saved
  in the `coverage/index.html` file, which can be opened in a browser. Try to achieve 100% coverage
  for any new functionality added.

- Every source file should have a corresponding test file, with the `_test` suffix. For example,
  if you're making a `SpookyEffect` and the source file is `src/effects/spooky_effect.dart`, then
  the test file should be `test/effects/spooky_effect_test.dart` mirroring the source directory.

- The test file should contain a `main()` function with a single `group()` whose name matches the
  name of the class being tested. If the source file contains multiple public classes, then each of
  them should have its own group. For example:

  ```dart
  void main() {
    group('SpookyEffect', () {
      // tests here
    });
  }
  ```

- For a larger class, multiple groups can be created inside the top-level group, allowing to
  navigate the test suite easier. The names of the nested groups should be capitalized.

- The names of the individual tests should normally start with a lowercase.

- Often, you would need to define multiple helper classes to run the tests. Such classes should be
  private (start with an underscore), and placed at the end of the file. The reason for this is that
  whenever some test breaks, the first thing one needs to do is to go into the test file and run all
  the tests. Having the `main()` function at the top of the file makes this process much easier.

## Types of tests

### Simple tests

```dart
test('the name of the test', () {
  expect(...);
});
```

This is the simplest kind of test available, and also the fastest. Use these tests for checking
some classes/methods that can function in isolation from the rest of the Flame framework.

### FlameGame tests

It is very common to want to have a `FlameGame` instance inside a test, so that you can add some
components to it and verify various behaviors. The following approach is recommended:

```dart
testWithFlameGame('the name of the test', (game) async {
  game.add(...);
  await game.ready();

  expect(...);
});
```

Here the `game` instance that is passed to the test body is a fully initialized game that behaves
as if it was mounted to a `GameWidget`. The `game.ready()` method waits until all the scheduled
components are loaded and mounted to the component tree.

The time within the `game` can be advanced with `game.update(dt)`.

If you need to have a custom game inside this test (say, a game with some mixin), then use

```dart
testWithGame<_MyGame>(
  'the name of the test',
  _MyGame.new,
  (game) async {
    // test body...
  },
);
```

### Widget tests

Sometimes having a "naked" `FlameGame` is insufficient, and you want to have access to the Flutter
infrastructure as well. That is, to have a game mounted into a real `GameWidget` embedded into an
actual Flutter framework. In such cases, use

```dart
testWidgets('test name', (tester) async {
  final game = _MyGame();
  await tester.pumpWidget(GameWidget(game: game));
  await tester.pump();
  await tester.pump();

  // At this point the game is fully initialized, and you can run your checks
  // against it.
  expect(...);

  // Equivalent to game.update(0)
  await tester.pump();

  // Advances in-game time by 20 milliseconds
  await tester.pump(const Duration(milliseconds: 20));
});
```

There are some additional methods available on the `tester` controller, for example in order to
simulate taps, or drags, or key presses.

### Golden tests

These tests verify that things render as intended. The process of creating a golden test is
simple:

1. Write the test, using the following template:

   ```dart
   testGolden(
     'the name of the test',
     (game) async {
        // Set up the game by adding the necessary components
        // You can add `expect()` checks here too, if you want to
     },
     size: Vector2(300, 200),
     goldenFile: '.../_goldens/my_test_file.png',
   );
   ```

   Here the `size` parameter determines the size of the game canvas and of the output image. The
   `goldenFile` parameter is the name of the file where you want to store the "golden" results. This
   should be a relative path to the `test/_goldens` directory, starting from your test file.

2. Run

   ```shell
   flutter test --update-goldens
   ```

   this would create the golden file for the first time. Open the file to verify that it renders
   exactly as you intended. If not, then delete the file and go back to step 1.

3. Subsequent runs of `flutter test` will check whether the output of the golden test matches the
   saved golden file. If not, Flutter will save the image-diff files into the `failures/` directory
   where your test is located.

```{note}
Avoid using text in your golden tests -- it does not render reliably across
different platforms, due to font discrepancies and differences in
anti-aliasing algorithms.
```

### Random tests

These are the tests that use a random number generator in order to construct a randomized input and
then check its correctness. Use as follows:

```dart
testRandom('test name', (Random random) {
  // Use [random] to generate random input
});
```

You can add `repeatCount: 1000` parameter to run this test the specified number of times, each one
with a different seed. It is useful to run a high `repeatCount` when developing the test, to ensure
that it doesn't break. However, when submitting the test to the main repository, avoid repeatCounts
higher than 10.

If the test breaks at some particular seed, then that seed will be shown in the test output. Add it
as the `seed: NNN` parameter to your test, and you'll be able to run it for the same seed as long
as you need until the test is fixed. Do not leave the `seed:` parameter when submitting your code,
as it defeats the purpose of having the test randomized.

# Camera & World

In most games the world is larger than what fits on screen at once. The camera controls which
portion of the game world is visible and how it is projected onto the player's display, handling
panning, zooming, and following characters. This is similar to how a
[`Viewport`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/RenderViewport-class.html) in Flutter determines
which part of a scrollable area is visible, but tailored for the free-form 2D coordinate space of
a game.

Example of a simple game structure:

```text
FlameGame
├── World
│   ├── Player
│   └── Enemy
└── CameraComponent
    ├── Viewfinder
    │   ├── HudButton
    │   └── FpsTextComponent
    └── Viewport
```

In order to understand how the `CameraComponent` works, imagine that your game
world is an entity that exists _somewhere_ independently from your application.
Imagine that your game is merely a window through which you can look into that
world. That you can close that window at any moment, and the game world would
still be there. Or, on the contrary, you can open multiple windows that all look
at the same world (or different worlds) at the same time.

With this mindset, we can now understand how the `CameraComponent` works.

First, there is the [World](#world) class, which contains all components that are
inside your game world. The `World` component can be mounted anywhere, for
example at the root of your game class, like the built-in `World` is.

Then, a [CameraComponent](#cameracomponent) class that "looks at" the [World](#world). The
`CameraComponent` has a [Viewport](#viewport) and a [Viewfinder](#viewfinder)
inside of it, allowing both the flexibility of rendering the world at any place
on the screen, and also controlling the viewing location and angle. The
`CameraComponent` also contains a [backdrop](#backdrop) component which is
statically rendered below the world.

## World

This component should be used to host all other components that comprise your
game world. The main property of the `World` class is that it does not render
through traditional means; instead it is rendered by one or more
[CameraComponent](#cameracomponent)s to "look at" the world. In the `FlameGame` class there is
one `World` called `world` which is added by default and paired together with
the default `CameraComponent` called `camera`.

A game can have multiple `World` instances that can be rendered either at the
same time, or at different times. For example, if you have two worlds A and B
and a single camera, then switching that camera's target from A to B will
instantaneously switch the view to world B without having to unmount A and
then mount B.

Just like with most `Component`s, children can be added to `World` by using the
`children` argument in its constructor, or by using the `add` or `addAll`
methods.

For many games you want to extend the world and create your logic in there,
such a game structure could look like this:

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(GameWidget(FlameGame(world: MyWorld())));
}

class MyWorld extends World {
  @override
  Future<void> onLoad() async {
    // Load all the assets that are needed in this world
    // and add components etc.
  }
}
```

## CameraComponent

This is a component through which a `World` is rendered. Multiple cameras can
observe the same world at the same time.

There is a default `CameraComponent` called `camera` on the `FlameGame` class
which is paired together with the default `world`, so you don't need to create
or add your own `CameraComponent` if your game doesn't need to.

A `CameraComponent` has two other components inside: a [Viewport](#viewport) and a
[Viewfinder](#viewfinder). Those components are always children of a camera.

The `FlameGame` class has a `camera` field in its constructor, so you can set
what type of default camera that you want, like this camera with a
[fixed resolution](#cameracomponent-with-fixed-resolution) for example:

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(
    GameWidget(
      FlameGame(
        camera: CameraComponent.withFixedResolution(
          width: 800,
          height: 600,
        ),
        world: MyWorld(),
      ),
    ),
  );
}
```

There is also a static property `CameraComponent.currentCamera` and it returns
the camera object that currently performs rendering. This is needed only for
certain advanced use cases where the rendering of a component depends on the
camera settings. For example, some components may decide to skip rendering
themselves and their children if they are outside of the camera's viewport.

### CameraComponent with fixed resolution

This named constructor will let you pretend that the user's device has a fixed resolution of your
choice. For example:

```dart
final camera = CameraComponent.withFixedResolution(
  world: myWorldComponent,
  width: 800,
  height: 600,
);
```

This will create a camera with a viewport centered in the middle of the screen, taking as much space
as possible while still maintaining the 4:3 (800x600) aspect ratio, and showing a game world region
of size 800 x 600.

A "fixed resolution" is very simple to work with, but it will underutilize the user's available
screen space, unless their device happens to have the same aspect ratio as your chosen dimensions.

## Viewport

The `Viewport` is a window through which the `World` is seen. That window
has a certain size, shape, and position on the screen. There are multiple kinds
of viewports available, and you can always implement your own.

The `Viewport` is a component, which means you can add other components to it.
These child components will be affected by the viewport's position, but not
by its clip mask. Thus, if a viewport is a "window" into the game world, then
its children are things that you can put on top of the window.

Adding elements to the viewport is a convenient way to implement "HUD"
components.

The following viewports are available:

- `MaxViewport` (default): this viewport expands to the maximum size allowed
  by the game, i.e. it will be equal to the size of the game canvas.
- `FixedResolutionViewport`: keeps the resolution and aspect ratio fixed, with black bars on the
  sides if it doesn't match the aspect ratio.
- `FixedSizeViewport`: a simple rectangular viewport with predefined size.
- `FixedAspectRatioViewport`: a rectangular viewport which expands to fit
  into the game canvas, but preserving its aspect ratio.
- `CircularViewport`: a viewport in the shape of a circle, fixed size.

If you add children to the `Viewport` they will appear as static HUDs in front of the world.

## Viewfinder

This part of the camera is responsible for knowing which location in the
underlying game world we are currently looking at. The `Viewfinder` also
controls the zoom level, and the rotation angle of the view.

The `anchor` property of the viewfinder allows you to designate which point
inside the viewport serves as a "logical center" of the camera. For example,
in side-scrolling action games it is common to have the camera focused on the
main character who is displayed not in the center of the screen but closer to
the lower-left corner. This off-center position would be the "logical center"
of the camera, controlled by the viewfinder's `anchor`.

If you add children to the `Viewfinder` they will appear in front of the world,
but behind the viewport and with the same transformations as are applied to the
world, so these components are not static.

You can also add behavioral components as children to the viewfinder, for
example [effects](effects.md) or other controllers. If you for example would add a
`ScaleEffect` you would be able to achieve a smooth zoom in your game.

## Backdrop

To add static components behind the world you can add them to the `backdrop`
component, or replace the `backdrop` component. This is for example useful if
you want to have a static `ParallaxComponent` that shows behind a world that
contains a player that can move around.

Example:

```dart
camera.backdrop.add(MyStaticBackground());
```

or

```dart
camera.backdrop = MyStaticBackground();
```

## Camera controls

There are several ways to modify a camera's settings at runtime:

1. Use camera functions such as `follow()`, `moveBy()` and `moveTo()`.
   Under the hood, this approach uses the same effects/behaviors as in (2).

2. Apply effects and/or behaviors to the camera's `Viewfinder` or `Viewport`.
   The effects and behaviors are special kinds of components whose purpose is
   to modify some property of a component over time.

3. Do it manually. You can always override the `CameraComponent.update()`
   method (or the same method on the viewfinder or viewport) and within it
   change the viewfinder's position or zoom as you see fit. This approach may
   be viable in some circumstances, but in general it is not recommended.

The `CameraComponent` has several methods for controlling its behavior:

- `follow()` will force the camera to follow the provided target.
  Optionally you can limit the maximum speed of movement of the camera, or
  allow it to only move horizontally/vertically.

- `stop()` will undo the effect of the previous call and stop the camera
  at its current position.

- `moveBy()` can be used to move the camera by the specified offset.
  If the camera was already following another component or moving,
  those behaviors would be automatically cancelled.

- `moveTo()` can be used to move the camera to the designated point on
  the world map. If the camera was already following another component or
  moving towards another point, those behaviors would be automatically
  cancelled.

- `setBounds()` allows you to add limits to where the camera is allowed to go. These limits
  are in the form of a `Shape`, which is commonly a rectangle, but can also be any other shape.

### visibleWorldRect

The camera exposes property `visibleWorldRect`, which is a rect that describes the world's region
which is currently visible through the camera. This region can be used in order to avoid rendering
components that are out of view, or updating objects that are far away from the player less
frequently.

The `visibleWorldRect` is a cached property, and it updates automatically whenever the camera
moves or the viewport changes its size.

### canSee

The `CameraComponent` has a method called `canSee` which can be used to check
if a component is visible from the camera point of view.
This is useful for example to cull components that are not in view.

```dart
if (!camera.canSee(component)) {
   component.removeFromParent(); // Cull the component
}
```

### Post processing

[Post processing](rendering/post_processing.md) is a technique used in game development to apply visual
effects to a component tree after it has been rendered. This can be added to the camera via the
`postProcess` property.

```dart
camera.postProcess = PostProcessGroup(
  postProcesses: [
    PostProcessSequentialGroup(
      postProcesses: [
        FireflyPostProcess(),
        WaterPostProcess(),
      ],
    ),
    ForegroundFogPostProcess(),
  ],
);
```

# Collision Detection

Almost every game needs to know when objects touch or overlap. Without collision detection a player
could walk through walls, bullets would pass through enemies, and coins could never be collected.
Flame provides a built-in collision detection system so you can focus on what _happens_ when objects
collide rather than writing the intersection math yourself.

Collision detection is needed in most games to detect and act upon two components intersecting each
other. For example, an arrow hitting an enemy or the player picking up a coin.

In most collision detection systems you use something called hitboxes to create more precise
bounding boxes of your components. In Flame the hitboxes are areas of the component that can react
to collisions and make [gesture input](inputs/gesture_input.md#gesturehitboxes) more accurate.

The collision detection system supports three different types of shapes that you can build hitboxes
from, these shapes are Polygon, Rectangle and Circle. Multiple hitboxes can be added to a
component to form the area which can be used to either detect collisions or determine whether it
contains a point. The latter is very useful for accurate gesture detection. The collision
detection does not handle what should happen when two hitboxes collide, so it is up to the user
to implement what will happen when for example two `PositionComponent`s have intersecting
hitboxes.

Do note that the built-in collision detection system does not take collisions between two hitboxes
that overshoot each other into account. This could happen when they either move very fast or
`update` is called with a large delta time (for example if your app is not in the foreground).
This behavior is called tunneling.

## Mixins

### HasCollisionDetection

If you want to use collision detection in your game you have to add the `HasCollisionDetection`
mixin to your game so that it can keep track of the components that can collide.

Example:

```dart
class MyGame extends FlameGame with HasCollisionDetection {
  // ...
}
```

Now when you add `ShapeHitbox`s to components that are then added to the game, they will
automatically be checked for collisions.

You can also add `HasCollisionDetection` directly to another `Component` instead
of the `FlameGame`,
for example to the `World` that is used for the `CameraComponent`.
If that is done, hitboxes that are added in that component's tree will only be compared to other
hitboxes in that subtree, which makes it possible to have several worlds with collision detection
within one `FlameGame`.

Example:

```dart
class CollisionDetectionWorld extends World with HasCollisionDetection {}
```

```{note}
Hitboxes will only be connected to one collision detection system and that is
the closest parent that has the `HasCollisionDetection` mixin.
```

### CollisionCallbacks

To react to a collision you should add the `CollisionCallbacks` mixin to your component.
Example:

```{flutter-app}
:sources: ../flame/examples
:page: collision_detection
:show: widget code infobox
:width: 180
:height: 160
```

```dart
class MyCollidable extends PositionComponent with CollisionCallbacks {
  @override
  void onCollision(Set<Vector2> points, PositionComponent other) {
    if (other is ScreenHitbox) {
      //...
    } else if (other is YourOtherComponent) {
      //...
    }
  }

  @override
  void onCollisionEnd(PositionComponent other) {
    if (other is ScreenHitbox) {
      //...
    } else if (other is YourOtherComponent) {
      //...
    }
  }
}
```

In this example we use Dart's `is` keyword to check what kind of component we collided with.
The set of points is where the edges of the hitboxes intersect.

Note that the `onCollision` method will be called on both `PositionComponent`s if they have both
implemented the `onCollision` method, and also on both hitboxes. The same goes for the
`onCollisionStart` and `onCollisionEnd` methods, which are called when two components and hitboxes
start or stop colliding with each other.

When a `PositionComponent` (and hitbox) starts to collide with another `PositionComponent`
both `onCollisionStart` and `onCollision` are called, so if you don't need to do something specific
when a collision starts you only need to override `onCollision`, and vice versa.

If you want to check collisions with the screen edges, as we do in the example above, you can use
the predefined [ScreenHitbox](#screenhitbox) class.

By default all hitboxes are hollow, this means that one hitbox can be fully enclosed by another
hitbox without triggering a collision. If you want to set your hitboxes to be solid you can set
`isSolid = true`. A hollow hitbox inside of a solid hitbox will trigger a collision, but not the
other way around. If there are no intersections with the edges on a solid hitbox the center
position is instead returned.

### Collision order

If a `Hitbox` collides with more than one other `Hitbox` within a given time step, then
the `onCollision` callbacks will be called in an essentially random order. In some cases this can
be a problem, such as in a bouncing ball game where the trajectory of the ball can differ depending
on which other object was hit first. To help resolve this the `collisionsCompletedNotifier`
listener can be used - this triggers at the end of the collision detection process.

An example of how this might be used is to add a local variable in your `PositionComponent` to save
the other components with which it's colliding:
`List<PositionComponent> collisionComponents = [];`. The `onCollision` callback is then used to
save all the other `PositionComponent`s to this list:

```dart
@override
void onCollision(Set<Vector2> intersectionPoints, PositionComponent other) {
  collisionComponents.add(other);
  super.onCollision(intersectionPoints, other);
}

```

Finally, one adds a listener to the `onLoad` method of the `PositionComponent` to call a function
which will resolve how the collisions should be dealt with:

```dart
(game as HasCollisionDetection)
    .collisionDetection
    .collisionsCompletedNotifier
    .addListener(() {
  resolveCollisions();
});
```

The list `collisionComponents` would need to be cleared in each call to `update`.

## ShapeHitbox

The `ShapeHitbox`s are normal components, so you add them to the component that you want to add
hitboxes to just like any other component:

```dart
class MyComponent extends PositionComponent {
  @override
  void onLoad() {
    add(RectangleHitbox());
  }
}
```

If you don't add any arguments to the hitbox, like above, the hitbox will try to fill its parent as
much as possible. Apart from having the hitboxes fill their parents, there are two ways to
initialize hitboxes. One is with the normal constructor where you define the hitbox by itself,
with a size and a position etc. The other way is to use the `relative` constructor which defines
the hitbox in relation to the size of its intended parent.

In some specific cases you might want to handle collisions only between hitboxes, without
propagating `onCollision*` events to the hitbox's parent component. For example, a vehicle could
have a body hitbox to control collisions and side hitboxes to check the possibility to turn left
or right.
So, colliding with a body hitbox means colliding with the component itself, whereas colliding with
a side hitbox does not mean a real collision and should not be propagated to hitbox's parent.
For this case you can set `triggersParentCollision` variable to `false`:

```dart
class MyComponent extends PositionComponent {

  late final MySpecialHitbox utilityHitbox;

  @override
  void onLoad() {
    utilityHitbox = MySpecialHitbox();
    add(utilityHitbox);
  }

  void update(double dt) {
    if (utilityHitbox.isColliding) {
      // do some specific things if hitbox is colliding
    }
  }
// component's onCollision* functions, ignoring MySpecialHitbox collisions.
}

class MySpecialHitbox extends RectangleHitbox {
  MySpecialHitbox() {
    triggersParentCollision = false;
  }

// hitbox specific onCollision* functions

}
```

You can read more about how the different shapes are defined in the
[ShapeComponents](components/shape_components.md) section.

Remember that you can add as many `ShapeHitbox`s as you want to your `PositionComponent` to make up
more complex areas. For example a snowman with a hat could be represented by three `CircleHitbox`s
and two `RectangleHitbox`s as its hat.

A hitbox can be used either for collision detection or for making gesture detection more accurate
on top of components, see more regarding the latter in the section about the
[GestureHitboxes](inputs/gesture_input.md#gesturehitboxes) mixin.

### CollisionType

The hitboxes have a field called `collisionType` which defines when a hitbox should collide with
another. Usually you want to set as many hitboxes as possible to `CollisionType.passive` to make
the collision detection more performant. By default the `CollisionType` is `active`.

The `CollisionType` enum contains the following values:

- `active` collides with other `Hitbox`es of type active or passive
- `passive` collides with other `Hitbox`es of type active
- `inactive` will not collide with any other `Hitbox`es

So if you have hitboxes that you don't need to check collisions against each other you can mark
them as passive by setting `collisionType: CollisionType.passive` in the constructor,
this could for example be ground components or maybe your enemies don't need
to check collisions between each other, then they could be marked as `passive` too.

Imagine a game where there are a lot of bullets, that can't collide with each other, flying towards
the player, then the player would be set to `CollisionType.active` and the bullets would be set to
`CollisionType.passive`.

Then we have the `inactive` type which simply doesn't get checked at all
in the collision detection.
This could be used for example if you have components outside of the screen that you don't care
about at the moment but that might later come back in to view so they are not completely removed
from the game.

These are just examples of how you could use these types, there will be a lot more use cases for
them so don't hesitate to use them even if your use case isn't listed here.

### PolygonHitbox

It should be noted that if you want to use collision detection or `containsPoint` on the `Polygon`,
the polygon needs to be convex. So always use convex polygons or you will most likely run into
problems if you don't really know what you are doing.

The other hitbox shapes don't have any mandatory constructor, that is because they can have a
default calculated from the size of the collidable that they are attached to, but since a
polygon can be made in an infinite number of ways inside of a bounding box you have to add the
definition in the constructor for this shape.

The `PolygonHitbox` has the same constructors as the [](components/shape_components.md#polygoncomponent),
see that section for documentation regarding those.

### RectangleHitbox

The `RectangleHitbox` has the same constructors as the [](components/shape_components.md#rectanglecomponent),
see that section for documentation regarding those.

### CircleHitbox

The `CircleHitbox` has the same constructors as the [](components/shape_components.md#circlecomponent),
see that section for documentation regarding those.

## ScreenHitbox

`ScreenHitbox` is a component which represents the edges of your viewport/screen. If you add a
`ScreenHitbox` to your game your other components with hitboxes will be notified when they
collide with the edges. It doesn't take any arguments, it only depends on the `size` of the game
that it is added to. To add it you can just do `add(ScreenHitbox())` in your game, if you don't
want the `ScreenHitbox` itself to be notified when something collides with it. Since
`ScreenHitbox` has the `CollisionCallbacks` mixin you can add your own `onCollisionCallback`,
`onStartCollisionCallback` and `onEndCollisionCallback` functions to that object if needed.

## CompositeHitbox

In the `CompositeHitbox` you can add multiple hitboxes so that
they emulate being one joined hitbox.

If you want to form a hat for example you might want
to use two [](#rectanglehitbox)s to follow that
hat's edges properly, then you can add those hitboxes to an instance of this class and react to
collisions to the whole hat, instead of for just each hitbox separately.

## Broad phase

If your game field isn't huge and does not have a lot of collidable components - you don't have to
worry about the broad phase system that is used, so if the standard implementation is performant
enough for you, you probably don't have to read this section.

A broad phase is the first step of collision detection where potential collisions are calculated.
Calculating these potential collisions is faster than checking the intersections exactly,
and it removes the need to check all hitboxes against each other and
therefore avoiding O(n²).

The broad phase produces a set of potential collisions (a set of
`CollisionProspect`s). This set is then used to check the exact intersections between
hitboxes (sometimes called "narrow phase").

By default, Flame's collision detection is using a sweep and prune broadphase step. If your game
requires another type of broadphase you can write your own broadphase by extending `Broadphase` and
manually setting the collision detection system that should be used.

For example, if you have implemented a broadphase built on a magic algorithm
instead of the standard sweep and prune, then you would do the following:

```dart
class MyGame extends FlameGame with HasCollisionDetection {
  MyGame() : super() {
    collisionDetection =
        StandardCollisionDetection(broadphase: MagicAlgorithmBroadphase());
  }
}
```

## Quad Tree broad phase

If your game field is large and the game contains a lot of collidable
components (more than a hundred), standard sweep and prune can
become inefficient. If it does, you can try to use the quad tree broad phase.

To do this, add the `HasQuadTreeCollisionDetection` mixin to your game instead of
`HasCollisionDetection` and call the `initializeCollisionDetection` function on game load:

```dart
class MyGame extends FlameGame with HasQuadTreeCollisionDetection {
  @override
  void onLoad() {
    initializeCollisionDetection(
      mapDimensions: const Rect.fromLTWH(0, 0, mapWidth, mapHeight),
      minimumDistance: 10,
    );
  }
}
```

When calling `initializeCollisionDetection` you should pass it the correct map dimensions, to make
the quad tree algorithm to work properly. There are also additional parameters to make the system
more efficient:

- `minimumDistance`: minimum distance between objects to consider them as possibly colliding.
  If `null` - the check is disabled, it is default behavior
- `maxObjects`: maximum objects count in one quadrant. Default to 25.
- `maxDepth`: maximum nesting levels inside quadrant. Default to 10

If you use the quad tree system, you can make it even more efficient by implementing the
`onComponentTypeCheck` function of the `CollisionCallbacks` mixin in your components.
It is useful if you need to prevent collisions of items of different types.
The result of the calculation is cached so
you should not check any dynamic parameters here, the function is intended to be used as a pure
type checker:

```dart
class Bullet extends PositionComponent with CollisionCallbacks {

  @override
  bool onComponentTypeCheck(PositionComponent other) {
    if (other is Player || other is Water) {
      // do NOT collide with Player or Water
      return false;
    }
    // Just return true if you're not interested in
    // the parent's type check result. Or call super
    // to override the result with the parent's result.
    return super.onComponentTypeCheck(other);
  }

  @override
  void onCollisionStart(
    Set<Vector2> intersectionPoints,
    PositionComponent other,
  ) {
    // Removes the component when it comes in contact with a Brick.
    // Neither Player nor Water would be passed to this function
    // because these classes are filtered out by [onComponentTypeCheck]
    // in an earlier stage.
    if (other is Brick) {
      removeFromParent();
    }
    super.onCollisionStart(intersectionPoints, other);
  }
}
```

After intensive gameplay a map could become over-clusterized with a lot of empty quadrants.
Run `QuadTree.optimize()` to perform a cleanup of empty quadrants:

```dart
class QuadTreeExample extends FlameGame
        with HasQuadTreeCollisionDetection {

  /// A function called when intensive gameplay session is over
  /// It also might be scheduled, but no need to run it on every update.
  /// Use right interval depending on your game circumstances
  onGameIdle() {
    (collisionDetection as QuadTreeCollisionDetection)
            .quadBroadphase
            .tree
            .optimize();
  }
}

```

```{note}
Always experiment with different collision detection approaches
and check how they perform on your game.
It is not unheard of that `QuadTreeBroadphase` is significantly
_slower_ than the default.
Don't assume that the more sophisticated approach is always faster.
```

## Ray casting and Ray tracing

Ray casting and ray tracing are methods for sending out rays from a point in your game and being
able to see what these rays collide with and how they reflect after hitting something.

For all of the following methods, if there are any hitboxes that you wish to ignore,
you can add the `ignoreHitboxes` argument which is a list of the hitboxes
that you wish to disregard for the call.
This can be quite useful for example if you are casting rays from within a hitbox,
which could be on your player or NPC;
or if you don't want a ray to bounce off a `ScreenHitbox`.

### Ray casting

Ray casting is the operation of casting out one or more rays from a point and see if they hit
anything, in Flame's case, hitboxes.

We provide two methods for doing so, `raycast` and `raycastAll`. The first one just casts out
a single ray and gets back a result with information about what and where the ray hit, and some
extra information like the distance, the normal and the reflection ray.
The second one, `raycastAll`,
works similarly but sends out multiple rays uniformly around the origin, or within an angle
centered at the origin.

By default, `raycast` and `raycastAll` scan for the nearest hit irrespective of
how far it lies from the ray origin.
But in some use cases, it might be interesting to find hits only within a certain
range. For such cases, an optional `maxDistance` can be provided.

To use the ray casting functionality you have to have the `HasCollisionDetection` mixin on your
game. After you have added that, you can call `collisionDetection.raycast(...)` on your game class,
or with the `HasGameReference` mixin from other components as well.

Example:

```{flutter-app}
:sources: ../flame/examples
:page: ray_cast
:show: widget code infobox
:width: 180
:height: 160
```

```dart
class MyGame extends FlameGame with HasCollisionDetection {
  @override
  void update(double dt) {
    super.update(dt);
    final ray = Ray2(
        origin: Vector2(0, 100),
        direction: Vector2(1, 0),
    );
    final result = collisionDetection.raycast(ray);
  }
}
```

In this example one can see that the `Ray2` class is being used, this class defines a ray from an
origin position and a direction (which are both defined by `Vector2`s). This particular ray starts
from `0, 100` and shoots a ray straight to the right.

The result from this operation will either be `null` if the ray didn't hit anything, or a
`RaycastResult` which contains:

- Which hitbox the ray hit
- The intersection point of the collision
- The reflection ray, i.e. how the ray would reflect on the hitbox that it hit
- The normal of the collision, i.e. a vector perpendicular to the face of the hitbox that it hits

If you are concerned about performance you can pre-create a `RaycastResult` object that you send in
to the method with the `out` argument, this will make it possible for the method to reuse this
object instead of creating a new one for each iteration. This can be good if you do a lot of
ray casting in your `update` methods.

#### raycastAll

Sometimes you want to send out rays in all, or a limited range, of directions from an origin. This
can have a lot of applications, for example you could calculate the field of view of a player or
enemy, or it can also be used to create light sources.

Example:

```dart
class MyGame extends FlameGame with HasCollisionDetection {
  @override
  void update(double dt) {
    super.update(dt);
    final origin = Vector2(200, 200);
    final result = collisionDetection.raycastAll(
      origin,
      numberOfRays: 100,
    );
  }
}
```

In this example we would send out 100 rays from (200, 200) uniformly spread in all directions.

If you want to limit the directions you can use the `startAngle` and the `sweepAngle` arguments.
Where the `startAngle` (counting from straight up) is where the rays will start and then the rays
will end at `startAngle + sweepAngle`.

If you are concerned about performance you can re-use the `RaycastResult` objects that are created
by the function by sending them in as a list with the `out` argument.

### Ray tracing

Ray tracing is similar to ray casting, but instead of just checking what the ray hits you can
continue to trace the ray and see what its reflection ray (the ray bouncing off the hitbox) will
hit and then what that casted reflection ray's reflection ray will hit and so on, until you decide
that you have traced the ray for long enough. If you imagine how a pool ball would bounce on a pool
table for example, that information could be retrieved with the help of ray tracing.

Example:

```{flutter-app}
:sources: ../flame/examples
:page: ray_trace
:show: widget code infobox
:width: 180
:height: 160
```

```dart
class MyGame extends FlameGame with HasCollisionDetection {
  @override
  void update(double dt) {
    super.update(dt);
    final ray = Ray2(
        origin: Vector2(0, 100),
        direction: Vector2(1, 1)..normalize()
    );
    final results = collisionDetection.raytrace(
      ray,
      maxDepth: 100,
    );
    for (final result in results) {
      if (result.intersectionPoint.distanceTo(ray.origin) > 300) {
        break;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

In the example above we send out a ray from (0, 100) diagonally down to the right
and we say that we want it to bounce on at most 100 hitboxes,
it doesn't necessarily have to get 100 results since at
some point one of the reflection rays might not hit a hitbox and then the method is done.

The method is lazy, which means that it will only do the calculations that you ask for, so you have
to loop through the iterable that it returns to get the results, or do `toList()` to directly
calculate all the results.

In the for-loop it can be seen how this can be used, in that loop we check whether the current
reflection rays intersection point (where the previous ray hit the hitbox) is further away than 300
pixels from the origin of the starting ray, and if it is we don't care about the rest
of the results (and then they don't have to be calculated either).

If you are concerned about performance you can re-use the `RaycastResult` objects that are created
by the function by sending them in as a list with the `out` argument.

## Comparison to Forge2D

If you want to have a full-blown physics engine in your game we recommend that you use
Forge2D by adding
[flame_forge2d](https://github.com/flame-engine/flame/tree/main/packages/flame_forge2d)
as a dependency.
But if you have a simpler use-case and just want to check for collisions of components and improve
the accuracy of gestures, Flame's built-in collision detection will serve you very well.

If you have the following needs you should at least consider using [Forge2D](https://github.com/flame-engine/forge2d):

- Realistic interacting forces
- Particle systems that can interact with other bodies
- Joints between bodies

On the other hand, it is a good idea to just use the Flame collision detection system if you only
need some of the following things (since it is simpler to not involve Forge2D):

- The ability to act on some of your components colliding
- The ability to act on your components colliding with the screen boundaries
- Complex shapes to act as a hitbox for your component so that gestures will be more accurate
- Hitboxes that can tell what part of a component that collided with something

# FlameGame

Every game needs a central object that owns the game loop, the continuous cycle of updating state
and rendering frames that drives all real-time games. In Flame, `FlameGame` fills that role while
also serving as the root of the component tree. If you are familiar with Flutter, think of
`FlameGame` as the equivalent of `MaterialApp`: the top-level entry point that everything else
hangs off of.

The base of almost all Flame games is the `FlameGame` class. It is the root of your component
tree. We refer to this component-based system as the Flame Component System (FCS). Throughout the
documentation, FCS is used to reference this system.

The `FlameGame` class implements a `Component` based `Game`. It has a tree of components
and calls the `update` and `render` methods of all components that have been added to the game.

Components can be added to the `FlameGame` directly in the constructor with the named `children`
argument, or from anywhere else with the `add`/`addAll` methods. Most of the time however, you want
to add your children to a `World`, the default world exists under `FlameGame.world` and you add
components to it just like you would to any other component.

A simple `FlameGame` implementation that adds two components, one in `onLoad` and one directly in
the constructor can look like this:

```dart
import 'package:flame/components.dart';
import 'package:flame/game.dart';
import 'package:flutter/widgets.dart';

/// A component that renders the crate sprite, with a 16 x 16 size.
class MyCrate extends SpriteComponent {
  MyCrate() : super(size: Vector2.all(16));

  @override
  Future<void> onLoad() async {
    sprite = await Sprite.load('crate.png');
  }
}

class MyWorld extends World {
  @override
  Future<void> onLoad() async {
    await add(MyCrate());
  }
}

void main() {
  final myGame = FlameGame(world: MyWorld());
  runApp(
    GameWidget(game: myGame),
  );
}
```

## Custom World type

`FlameGame` has a generic type parameter `W` that defaults to `World`. By specifying a custom world
type, the `world` getter on your game will return your specific world type directly, without needing
to cast it.

This is useful when you have a custom `World` subclass and want to access its properties or methods
from within your game class:

```dart
class MyWorld extends World {
  int score = 0;
}

class MyGame extends FlameGame<MyWorld> {
  MyGame() : super(world: MyWorld());

  void incrementScore() {
    // No cast needed, `world` is already typed as `MyWorld`.
    world.score++;
  }
}
```

When using this generic parameter, you **must** pass a matching world instance to the `super`
constructor. If the generic type is specified but no world is provided, a runtime assertion error
will be thrown.

```{note}
If you instantiate your game in a build method your game will be rebuilt every
time the Flutter tree gets rebuilt, which usually is more often than you'd like.
To avoid this, you can either create an instance of your game first and
reference it within your widget structure or use the `GameWidget.controlled`
constructor.
```

To remove components from the list on a `FlameGame` the `remove` or `removeAll` methods can be used.
The first can be used if you just want to remove one component, and the second can be used when you
want to remove a list of components. These methods exist on all `Component`s, including the `World`.

The `FlameGame` has a built-in `World` called `world` and a `CameraComponent` instance called
`camera`, you can read more about those in the [Camera section](camera.md).

## Game Loop

The `GameLoop` module is a simple abstraction of the game loop concept. Basically, most games are
built upon two methods:

- The render method takes the canvas for drawing the current state of the game.
- The update method receives the delta time in seconds since the last update and allows you to
  move to the next state.

The `GameLoop` is used by all of Flame's `Game` implementations.

## Resizing

Every time the game needs to be resized, for example when the orientation is changed, `FlameGame`
will call all of the `Component`'s `onGameResize` methods and it will also pass this information to
the camera and viewport.

The `FlameGame.camera` controls which point in the coordinate space that should be at the anchor of
your viewfinder, [0,0] is in the center (`Anchor.center`) of the viewport by default.

## Lifecycle

The `FlameGame` lifecycle callbacks, `onLoad`, `render`, etc. are called in the following sequence:

```{include} diagrams/flame_game_life_cycle.md

```

When a `FlameGame` is first added to a `GameWidget` the lifecycle methods `onGameResize`, `onLoad`
and `onMount` will be called in that order. Then `update` and `render` are called in sequence for
every game tick. If the `FlameGame` is removed from the `GameWidget` then `onRemove` is called.
If the `FlameGame` is added to a new `GameWidget` the sequence repeats from `onGameResize`.

```{note}
The order of `onGameResize` and `onLoad` are reversed from that of other
`Component`s. This is to allow game element sizes to be calculated before
resources are loaded or generated.
```

The `onRemove` callback can be used to clean up children and cached data:

```dart
  @override
  void onRemove() {
    // Optional based on your game needs.
    removeAll(children);
    processLifecycleEvents();
    Flame.images.clearCache();
    Flame.assets.clearCache();
    // Any other code that you want to run when the game is removed.
  }
```

```{note}
Clean-up of children and resources in a `FlameGame` is not done automatically
and must be explicitly added to the `onRemove` call.
```

### onHotReload

When Flutter's hot reload is triggered (debug mode only), the `GameWidget` calls `onHotReload` on
the `FlameGame`, which automatically propagates the notification to every component in the tree that
is loading or loaded. Override this method on any component to reload assets, refresh cached values,
or react to source code changes during development:

```dart
class MyGame extends FlameGame {
  @override
  void onHotReload() {
    // Refresh game-level state affected by code changes.
    super.onHotReload();
  }
}
```

```{note}
`onHotReload` is only called in debug mode. Components that are still in the
lifecycle queue (loading but not yet mounted) also receive the notification.
Always call `super.onHotReload()` so the event continues to propagate to
children.
```

### dispose()

As a convenience, `FlameGame` provides a `dispose()` method that handles all of the common cleanup
in a single call:

```dart
  game.dispose();
```

This removes all children from the game (triggering `onRemove` on every component in the tree),
processes all pending lifecycle events, and clears the `images` and `assets` caches.

The difference between `dispose()` and `onRemove` is that `dispose()` is a method you call
explicitly to perform cleanup, while `onRemove` is a lifecycle callback that is invoked
automatically when the game is removed from a `GameWidget`. You can use `dispose()` from within
`onRemove`, or call it independently whenever you need to reset the game state.

## Debug mode

Flame's `FlameGame` class provides a variable called `debugMode`, which by default is `false`. It
can, however, be set to `true` to enable debug features for the components of the game. **Be aware**
that the value of this variable is passed through to its components when they are added to the
game, so if you change the `debugMode` at runtime, it will not affect already added components by
default.

To read more about the `debugMode` on Flame, please refer to the [Debug Docs](other/debug.md)

## Change background color

To change the background color of your `FlameGame` you have to override `backgroundColor()`.

In the following example, the background color is set to be fully transparent, so that you can see
the widgets that are behind the `GameWidget`. The default is opaque black.

```dart
class MyGame extends FlameGame {
  @override
  Color backgroundColor() => const Color(0x00000000);
}
```

Note that the background color can't change dynamically while the game is running, but you could
just draw a background that covers the whole canvas if you would want it to change dynamically.

## SingleGameInstance mixin

An optional mixin `SingleGameInstance` can be applied to your game if you are making a single-game
application. This is a common scenario when building games: there is a single full-screen
`GameWidget` that hosts a single `Game` instance.

Adding this mixin provides performance advantages in certain scenarios. In particular, a component's
`onLoad` method is guaranteed to start when that component is added to its parent, even if the
parent is not yet mounted itself. Consequently, `await`-ing on `parent.add(component)` is guaranteed
to always finish loading the component.

Using this mixin is simple:

```dart
class MyGame extends FlameGame with SingleGameInstance {
  // ...
}
```

## Low-level Game API

```{include} diagrams/low_level_game_api.md

```

The abstract `Game` class is a low-level API that can be used when you want to implement the
functionality of how the game engine should be structured. `Game` does not implement any `update` or
`render` function for example.

The class also has the lifecycle methods `onLoad`, `onMount` and `onRemove` in it, which are
called from the `GameWidget` (or another parent) when the game is loaded + mounted, or removed.
`onLoad` is only called the first time the class is added to a parent, but `onMount` (which is
called after `onLoad`) is called every time it is added to a new parent. `onRemove` is called when
the class is removed from a parent.

```{note}
The `Game` class allows for more freedom of how to implement things, but you
are also missing out on all of the built-in features in Flame if you use it.
```

An example of what a `Game` implementation could look like:

```dart
class MyGameSubClass extends Game {
  @override
  void render(Canvas canvas) {
    // ...
  }

  @override
  void update(double dt) {
    // ...
  }
}

void main() {
  final myGame = MyGameSubClass();
  runApp(
    GameWidget(
      game: myGame,
    )
  );
}
```

## Pause/Resuming/Stepping game execution

A Flame `Game` can be paused and resumed in two ways:

- With the use of the `pauseEngine` and `resumeEngine` methods.
- By changing the `paused` attribute.

When pausing a `Game`, the `GameLoop` is effectively paused, meaning that no updates or new renders
will happen until it is resumed.

While the game is paused, it is possible to advance it frame by frame using the `stepEngine`
method. It might not be very useful in the final game, but it can be very helpful for inspecting
game state step by step during the development cycle.

### Backgrounding

The game will be automatically paused when the app is sent to the background,
and resumed when it comes back to the foreground. This behavior can be disabled by setting
`pauseWhenBackgrounded` to `false`.

```dart
class MyGame extends FlameGame {
  MyGame() {
    pauseWhenBackgrounded = false;
  }
}
```

This flag currently only works on Android and iOS.

## HasPerformanceTracker mixin

While optimizing a game, it can be useful to track the time it took for the game to update and
render each frame. This data can help in detecting areas of the code that are running hot. It can
also help
in detecting visual areas of the game that are taking the most time to render.

To get the update and render times, just add the `HasPerformanceTracker` mixin to the game class.

```dart
class MyGame extends FlameGame with HasPerformanceTracker {
  // access `updateTime` and `renderTime` getters.
}
```

# Game Widget

The `GameWidget` is the bridge between Flutter and Flame. Since Flame games are not Flutter widgets
by themselves, the `GameWidget` wraps a `Game` instance and places it into the Flutter widget tree,
just like any other [widget](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/fundamentals/widgets). This lets
you combine a full-screen game with Flutter UI elements (navigation bars, overlays, dialogs) or
embed a game as only part of your app's layout.

```{dartdoc}
:package: flame
:symbol: GameWidget
:file: src/game/game_widget/game_widget.dart

[ClipRect]: https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/ClipRect-class.html
[FocusNode]: https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/FocusNode-class.html
[RepaintBoundary]: https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/RepaintBoundary-class.html
```

## Hit Test Behavior

The `behavior` argument controls how the `GameWidget` participates in Flutter's hit testing. This
determines whether pointer events (taps, drags, etc.) are absorbed by the game or allowed to pass
through to widgets underneath it in the widget tree.

There are three possible values from Flutter's `HitTestBehavior`:

- **`HitTestBehavior.opaque`** (default): The game absorbs all pointer events on its entire surface,
  preventing any widgets behind it from receiving them. This is the classic behavior where the game
  acts as a solid layer.

- **`HitTestBehavior.deferToChild`**: The game only intercepts events at positions where a component
  with event callbacks (e.g. `TapCallbacks`) exists. Events at positions with no interactive
  components pass through to widgets behind the `GameWidget`. This is useful when layering a game on
  top of Flutter UI and you want the underlying widgets to remain interactive in areas the game
  doesn't need to handle.

- **`HitTestBehavior.translucent`**: The game receives events where it has event-handling
  components, but always allows widgets behind it to be hit-tested as well. Both the game and the
  widgets behind it can receive the same event.

### Allowing taps to pass through

A common use case is placing a `GameWidget` on top of other Flutter widgets in a `Stack`. By
default, the game will block all interaction with the widgets underneath. To let taps pass through
to those widgets, set `behavior` to `HitTestBehavior.deferToChild`:

```dart
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Stack(
    children: [
      // Flutter widgets underneath
      Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () => print('Button tapped!'),
          child: const Text('Tap me'),
        ),
      ),
      // Game on top, letting taps pass through
      Positioned.fill(
        child: GameWidget(
          game: MyGame(),
          behavior: HitTestBehavior.deferToChild,
        ),
      ),
    ],
  );
}
```

In this setup, tapping an area with no interactive game components will reach the `ElevatedButton`
behind the game. Tapping a game component that uses `TapCallbacks` will be handled by the game
instead.

```{note}
When using `deferToChild` or `translucent`, `FlameGame` determines whether a
position has an interactive component by traversing the component tree via
`componentsAtPoint`. Games that directly extend the low-level `Game` class
report a hit on their entire surface by default; override
`containsEventHandlerAt` to customize this.
```

# Overlays

Games often need to display Flutter widgets on top of the game canvas for things like pause menus,
score displays, or chat interfaces. Because Flame games live inside a Flutter widget tree, you can
layer any Flutter widget over the game surface. The Overlays API makes this especially convenient
by letting you toggle named widget overlays on and off from within your game code.

Since a Flame game can be wrapped in a widget, it is quite easy to use it alongside other Flutter
widgets in your tree. However, if you want to easily show widgets on top of your Flame game, like
messages, menu screens or something of that nature, you can use the Widgets Overlay API to make
things even easier.

`Game.overlays` enables any Flutter widget to be shown on top of a game instance. This makes it very
easy to create things like a pause menu or an inventory screen for example.

The feature can be used via the `game.overlays.add` and `game.overlays.remove` methods that mark an
overlay to be shown or hidden, respectively, via a `String` argument that identifies the overlay.
After that, you can map each overlay to their corresponding Widget in your `GameWidget` declaration
by providing an `overlayBuilderMap`.

```dart
  // Inside your game:
  final pauseOverlayIdentifier = 'PauseMenu';
  final secondaryOverlayIdentifier = 'SecondaryMenu';

  // Marks 'SecondaryMenu' to be rendered.
  overlays.add(secondaryOverlayIdentifier, priority: 1);
  // Marks 'PauseMenu' to be rendered. Priority = 0 by default
  // which means the 'PauseMenu' will be displayed under the 'SecondaryMenu'
  overlays.add(pauseOverlayIdentifier);
  // Marks 'PauseMenu' to not be rendered.
  overlays.remove(pauseOverlayIdentifier);
  // Toggles the 'PauseMenu' overlay.
  overlays.toggle(pauseOverlayIdentifier);
```

```dart
// On the widget declaration
final game = MyGame();

Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return GameWidget(
    game: game,
    overlayBuilderMap: {
      'PauseMenu': (BuildContext context, MyGame game) {
        return Text('A pause menu');
      },
      'SecondaryMenu': (BuildContext context, MyGame game) {
        return Text('A secondary menu');
      },
    },
  );
}
```

The order of rendering for an overlay is determined by the order of the keys in the
`overlayBuilderMap`.

See an [example of the Overlays feature](https://github.com/flame-engine/flame/blob/main/examples/lib/stories/system/overlays_example.dart).

# Supported Platforms

One of Flame's biggest advantages is that it inherits Flutter's cross-platform reach. A single
codebase can produce games for phones, desktops, and the web. This section covers platform
support details and shows how to deploy your finished game to popular hosting services.

Since Flame runs on top of Flutter, its supported platforms depend on which platforms are
supported by Flutter.

At the moment, Flame supports web, mobile (Android and iOS) and desktop (Windows, macOS and Linux).

## Flutter channels

Flame keeps its support on the stable channel. The dev, beta and master channels should work,
but we don't support them. This means that issues happening outside the stable channel are not
a priority.

## Deploy your game to GitHub Pages

One easy way to deploy your game online is to use [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
It is a cool feature from GitHub, by which you can easily host web content from your repository.

Here we will explain the easiest way to get your game hosted using GitHub pages.

First, let's create the branch where your deployed files will live:

```shell
git checkout -b gh-pages
```

This branch can be created from `main` or any other place, it doesn't matter much. After you push
that branch go back to your `main` branch.

Now you should add the [flutter-gh-pages](https://github.com/bluefireteam/flutter-gh-pages)
action to your repository, you can do that by creating a file `gh-pages.yaml` under the folder
`.github/workflows`.

```yaml
name: Gh-Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: subosito/flutter-action@v2
      - uses: bluefireteam/flutter-gh-pages@v8
        with:
          baseHref: /NAME_OF_YOUR_REPOSITORY/
          webRenderer: canvaskit
```

Be sure to change `NAME_OF_YOUR_REPOSITORY` to the name of your GitHub repository.

Now, whenever you push something to the `main` branch, the action will run and update your
deployed game.

The game should be available at a URL like this:
`https://YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io/NAME_OF_YOUR_REPOSITORY/`

## Deploy your game to itch.io

1. Create a web build, either from your IDE or by running `flutter build web`
   (If it complains about `Missing index.html` run `flutter create . --platforms=web`)
2. Go into `index.html` and remove the line that says `<base href="/">`
3. zip the `build/web` folder and upload to itch.io

**Remember that it shouldn't be the `web` directory in your project's root, but in `build/web`!**

If you are submitting your game to a game jam, remember to make it public and submit it on the
game jam page too (many get confused by this).

Further instructions can be found on
[itch.io](https://itch.io/docs/creators/html5#getting-started/zip-file).

## Deploy your game to Cloudflare Pages

```{note}
Automated deployment to Cloudflare Pages is only available for GitHub and GitLab
repositories.
```

[Cloudflare pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) is another interesting option to host your
Flame game online.

Setting up an automated deployment on it is super simple and can be achieved in a few steps:

First, create your account on Cloudflare, and once you are logged in, use the `+ Add` button on
the top right corner to create your page project.

![Cloudflare add menu screenshot](../images/add_button.png)

Next follow the steps to connect your repository, you can choose between GitHub and GitLab.

You should then be presented with a screen to configure your project name, which should be
pre-filled with the name of your repository, and the production branch, which will also
be pre-filled with `main`.

Scrolling down you will see the build settings panel, which should look like this:

![Cloudflare build settings screenshot](../images/build_form.png)

Leave the `Framework preset` as `None` since Flutter is not supported out of the box.

Then on the `Build command` field, enter the following command:

```shell
if cd flutter; then git pull && cd ..;else
git clone https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git; fi &&
../flutter/bin/flutter doctor && ../flutter/bin/flutter clean &&
../flutter/bin/flutter build web --release
```

It should be entered as a single line, but below you can see it split into multiple lines for
better readability:

```shell
if cd flutter; then
  git pull && cd ..
else
  git clone https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git
fi
../flutter/bin/flutter doctor
../flutter/bin/flutter clean
../flutter/bin/flutter build web --release
```

Some people might prefer to create a bash script in the root of their repository with the above
commands and use it instead of entering the commands directly in the field, so it is up to you.

Set the Build output directory to `build/web`.

If needed use the advanced options to set environment variables.

Finally, click on the `Save and Deploy` button to start the deployment and that is it. You should
have automation ready to deploy your game to Cloudflare Pages every time you push to your
repository.

### Web support

When using Flame on the web some methods may not work. For example `Flame.device.setOrientation` and
`Flame.device.fullScreen` won't work on web, they can be called, but nothing will happen.

Another example: pre-caching audio using the `flame_audio` package also doesn't work due to
Audioplayers not supporting it on web. This can be worked around by using the `http` package,
and requesting a get to the audio file, that will make the browser cache the file producing the
same effect as on mobile.

If you want to create instances of `ui.Image` on the web you can use our
`Flame.images.decodeImageFromPixels` method. This wraps the `decodeImageFromPixels` from the `ui`
library, but with support for the web platform. If the `runAsWeb` argument is set to `true` (by
default it is set to `kIsWeb`) it will decode the image using an internal image method. When the
`runAsWeb` is `false` it will use the `decodeImageFromPixels`, which is currently not supported on
the web.

## File: flame/router.md

---

```{flutter-app}
:sources: ../flame/examples
:page: router
:show: widget code infobox

This example app shows the use of the `RouterComponent` to move across multiple
screens within the game. In addition, the "pause" button stops time and applies
visual effects to the content of the page below it.
```

# RouterComponent

Most games consist of more than a single screen: there is a main menu, a settings page, the
gameplay screen, pop-up dialogs, and so on. Managing the transitions between these screens can
quickly become messy. The `RouterComponent` solves this by providing a stack-based navigation
model, similar in spirit to Flutter's [Navigator][Flutter Navigator] class, except that it works
with Flame components instead of Flutter widgets.

A typical game will usually consist of multiple pages: the splash screen, the starting menu page,
the settings page, credits, the main game page, several pop-ups, etc. The router will organize
all these destinations and allow you to transition between them.

Internally, the `RouterComponent` contains a stack of routes. When you request it to show a route,
it will be placed on top of all other pages in the stack. Later you can `pop()` to remove the
topmost page from the stack. The pages of the router are addressed by their unique names.

Each page in the router can be either transparent or opaque. If a page is opaque, then the pages
below it in the stack are not rendered and do not receive pointer events (such as taps or drags).
On the contrary, if a page is transparent, then the page below it will be rendered and receive
events normally. Such transparent pages are useful for implementing modal dialogs, inventory or
dialogue UIs, etc. If you want your route to be visually transparent but for the routes below it
to not receive events, make sure to add a background component to your route that captures the
events by using one of the [event capturing mixins](inputs/inputs.md).

Usage example:

```dart
class MyGame extends FlameGame {
  late final RouterComponent router;

  @override
  void onLoad() {
    add(
      router = RouterComponent(
        routes: {
          'home': Route(HomePage.new),
          'level-selector': Route(LevelSelectorPage.new),
          'settings': Route(SettingsPage.new, transparent: true),
          'pause': PauseRoute(),
          'confirm-dialog': OverlayRoute.existing(),
        },
        initialRoute: 'home',
      ),
    );
  }
}

class PauseRoute extends Route { ... }
```

```{note}
Use `hide Route` if any of your imported packages export
another class called `Route`

e.g.: `import 'package:flutter/material.dart' hide Route;`
```

[Flutter Navigator]: https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Navigator-class.html

## Route

The **Route** component holds information about the content of a particular page. `Route`s are
mounted as children to the `RouterComponent`.

The main property of a `Route` is its `builder`, the function that creates the component with
the content of its page.

In addition, the routes can be either transparent or opaque (default). An opaque route prevents
the route below it from rendering or receiving pointer events, while a transparent route does
not. As a rule of thumb, declare the route opaque if it is full-screen, and transparent if it
is supposed to cover only a part of the screen.

By default, routes maintain the state of the page component after being popped from the stack
and the `builder` function is only called the first time a route is activated. Setting
`maintainState` to `false` drops the page component after the route is popped from the route stack
and the `builder` function is called each time the route is activated.

The current route can be replaced using `pushReplacementNamed` or `pushReplacement`. Each method
simply executes `pop` on the current route and then `pushNamed` or `pushRoute`.

## WorldRoute

The **WorldRoute** is a special route that allows setting active game worlds via the router.
This type of route can for example be used for swapping levels implemented as separate worlds in
your game.

By default, the `WorldRoute` will replace the current world with the new one and by default it will
keep the state of the world after being popped from the stack. If you want the world to be recreated
each time the route is activated, set `maintainState` to `false`.

If you are not using the built-in `CameraComponent` you can pass in the camera that you want to use
explicitly in the constructor.

```dart
final router = RouterComponent(
  routes: {
    'level1': WorldRoute(MyWorld1.new),
    'level2': WorldRoute(MyWorld2.new, maintainState: false),
  },
);

class MyWorld1 extends World {
  @override
  Future<void> onLoad() async {
    add(BackgroundComponent());
    add(PlayerComponent());
  }
}

class MyWorld2 extends World {
   @override
   Future<void> onLoad() async {
      add(BackgroundComponent());
      add(PlayerComponent());
      add(EnemyComponent());
   }
}
```

## OverlayRoute

The **OverlayRoute** is a special route that allows adding game overlays via the router. These
routes are transparent by default.

There are two constructors for the `OverlayRoute`. The first constructor requires a builder function
that describes how the overlay's widget is to be built. The second constructor can be used when the
builder function was already specified within the `GameWidget`:

```dart
final router = RouterComponent(
  routes: {
    'ok-dialog': OverlayRoute(
      (context, game) {
        return Center(
          child: DecoratedContainer(...),
        );
      },
    ),  // OverlayRoute
    'confirm-dialog': OverlayRoute.existing(),
  },
);
```

Overlays that were defined within the `GameWidget` don't even need to be declared within the routes
map beforehand: the `RouterComponent.pushOverlay()` method can do it for you. Once an overlay route
was registered, it can be activated either via the regular `.pushNamed()` method, or via the
`.pushOverlay()`. The two methods will do exactly the same, though you can use the second one to
make it more clear in your code that an overlay is being added instead of a regular route.

The current overlay can be replaced using `pushReplacementOverlay`. This method executes
`pushReplacementNamed` or `pushReplacement` based on the status of the overlay being pushed.

## ValueRoute

```{flutter-app}
:sources: ../flame/examples
:page: value_route
:show: widget code infobox
:width: 280
```

A **ValueRoute** is a route that will return a value when it is eventually popped from the stack.
Such routes can be used, for example, for dialog boxes that ask for some feedback from the user.

In order to use `ValueRoute`s, two steps are required:

1. Create a route derived from the `ValueRoute<T>` class, where `T` is the type of the value that
   your route will return. Inside that class override the `build()` method to construct the
   component that will be displayed. The component should use the `completeWith(value)` method to
   pop the route and return the specified value.

   ```dart
   class YesNoDialog extends ValueRoute<bool> {
     YesNoDialog(this.text) : super(value: false);
     final String text;

     @override
     Component build() {
       return PositionComponent(
         children: [
           RectangleComponent(),
           TextComponent(text: text),
           Button(
             text: 'Yes',
             action: () => completeWith(true),
           ),
           Button(
             text: 'No',
             action: () => completeWith(false),
           ),
         ],
       );
     }
   }
   ```

2. Display the route using `Router.pushAndWait()`, which returns a future that resolves with the
   value returned from the route.

   ```dart
   Future<void> foo() async {
     final result = await game.router.pushAndWait(YesNoDialog('Are you sure?'));
     if (result) {
       // ... the user is sure
     } else {
       // ... the user was not so sure
     }
   }
   ```

# Assets Directory Structure

Games rely heavily on external assets like images for sprites, audio files for sound effects, and
tile maps for levels. Organizing these files consistently ensures that Flame's built-in loaders
(and Flutter's own [asset system](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/assets/assets-and-images)) can find
them without extra configuration.

Flame has a proposed structure for your project that includes the standard Flutter `assets`
directory in addition to some children: `audio`, `images` and `tiles`.

If using the following example code:

```dart
class MyGame extends FlameGame {
  @override
  Future<void> onLoad() async {
    await FlameAudio.play('explosion.mp3');

    // Load some images
    await Flame.images.load('player.png');
    await Flame.images.load('enemy.png');

    // Or load all images in your images folder
    await Flame.images.loadAllImages();

    final map1 = await TiledComponent.load('level.tmx', tileSize);
  }
}
```

The following file structure is where Flame would expect to find the files:

```text
.
└── assets
    ├── audio
    │   └── explosion.mp3
    ├── images
    │   ├── enemy.png
    │   ├── player.png
    │   └── spritesheet.png
    └── tiles
        ├── level.tmx
        └── map.json
```

Optionally you can split your `audio` folder into two subfolders, one for `music` and one for `sfx`.

Don't forget to add these files to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
flutter:
  assets:
    - assets/audio/explosion.mp3
    - assets/images/player.png
    - assets/images/enemy.png
    - assets/tiles/level.tmx
```

If you want to change this structure, this is possible by using the `prefix` parameter and creating
your instances of `AssetsCache`, `Images`, and `AudioCache`, instead of using the
global ones provided by Flame.

Additionally, `AssetsCache` and `Images` can receive a custom
[`AssetBundle`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/services/AssetBundle-class.html).
This can be used to make Flame look for assets in a different location other than the `rootBundle`,
like the file system for example.

# Components

In game development, a component is a self-contained unit that encapsulates a specific piece of game
behavior or visual. Flame uses the [Flame Component System](../game.md) (FCS) where every object in
your game (players, enemies, backgrounds, UI elements) is a component. This makes games easier to
build and maintain because each piece of logic lives in its own class and components can be freely
composed into a tree, much like
[Flutter's widget tree](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/fundamentals/widgets).

- [Position Component](position_component.md)
- [Sprite Components](sprite_components.md)
- [Parallax Component](parallax_component.md)
- [Shape Components](shape_components.md)
- [Utility Components](utility_components.md)

```{include} ../diagrams/component.md

```

This diagram might look intimidating, but don't worry, it is not as complex as it looks.

## Component

All components inherit from the `Component` class and can have other `Component`s as children.
This is the base of what we call the Flame Component System, or FCS for short.

Children can be added either with the `add(Component c)` method or directly in the constructor.

Example:

```dart
void main() {
  final component1 = Component(children: [Component(), Component()]);
  final component2 = Component();
  component2.add(Component());
  component2.addAll([Component(), Component()]);
}
```

The `Component()` here could of course be any subclass of `Component`.

Every `Component` has a few methods that you can optionally implement, which are used by the
`FlameGame` class.

### Component lifecycle

```{include} ../diagrams/component_life_cycle.md

```

The `onGameResize` method is called whenever the screen is resized, and also when this component
gets added into the component tree, before the `onMount`.

The `onParentResize` method is similar: it is also called when the component is mounted into the
component tree, and also whenever the parent of the current component changes its size.

The `onRemove` method can be overridden to run code before the component is removed from the game.
It is only run once even if the component is removed both by using the parent's remove method and
the `Component` remove method.

The `onLoad` method can be overridden to run asynchronous initialization code for the component,
like loading an image for example. This method is executed before `onGameResize` and
`onMount`. This method is guaranteed to execute only once during the lifetime of the component, so
you can think of it as an "asynchronous constructor".

The `onMount` method runs every time the component is mounted into a game tree. This means that
you should not initialize `late final` variables here, since this method might run several times
throughout the component's lifetime. This method will only run if the parent is already mounted.
If the parent is not mounted yet, then this method will wait in a queue (this will have no effect
on the rest of the game engine).

The `onChildrenChanged` method can be overridden if it's needed to detect changes in a parent's
children. This method is called whenever a child is added to or removed from a parent (this includes
if a child is changing its parent). Its parameters contain the target child and the type of
change it went through (`added` or `removed`).

The `onHotReload` method is called on every component in the tree when Flutter's hot reload is
triggered (debug mode only). Override this method to reload assets, recalculate cached values, or
perform other actions in response to code changes during development. The notification propagates
automatically to all children that are loading or loaded, so you must call `super.onHotReload()`
in your override:

```dart
class MyComponent extends Component {
  @override
  void onHotReload() {
    super.onHotReload();
    // Re-read values that may have changed in source code.
    _cachedValue = _computeExpensiveValue();
  }
}
```

A component's lifecycle state can be checked by a series of getters:

- `isLoaded`: Returns a bool with the current loaded state.
- `loaded`: Returns a future that will complete once the component has finished loading.
- `isMounted`: Returns a bool with the current mounted state.
- `mounted`: Returns a future that will complete once the component has finished mounting.
- `isRemoved`: Returns a bool with the current removed state.
- `removed`: Returns a future that will complete once the component has been removed.

### Priority

In Flame every `Component` has the `int priority` property, which determines
that component's sorting order within its parent's children. This is sometimes referred to
as `z-index` in other languages and frameworks. The higher the `priority` is set to, the
closer the component will appear on the screen, since it will be rendered on top of any components
with lower priority that were rendered before it.

If you add two components and set one of their priorities to 1 for example, then that component will
be rendered on top of the other component (if they overlap), because the default priority is 0.

All components take in `priority` as a named argument, so if you know the priority that you want
your component at compile time, then you can pass it in to the constructor.

Example:

```dart
class MyGame extends FlameGame {
  @override
  void onLoad() {
    final myComponent = PositionComponent(priority: 5);
    add(myComponent);
  }
}
```

To update the priority of a component you have to set it to a new value, like
`component.priority = 2`, and it will be updated in the current tick before the rendering stage.

In the following example we first initialize the component with priority 1, and then when the
user taps the component we change its priority to 2:

```dart
class MyComponent extends PositionComponent with TapCallbacks {

  MyComponent() : super(priority: 1);

  @override
  void onTapDown(TapDownEvent event) {
    priority = 2;
  }
}
```

### Composability of components

Sometimes it is useful to wrap other components inside of your component. For example by grouping
visual components through a hierarchy. You can do this by adding child components to any component,
for example `PositionComponent`.

When you have child components on a component every time the parent is updated and rendered, all the
children are rendered and updated with the same conditions.

Here's an example where the visibility of two components is handled by a wrapper:

```dart
class GameOverPanel extends PositionComponent {
  bool visible = false;
  final Image spriteImage;

  GameOverPanel(this.spriteImage);

  @override
  void onLoad() {
    // GameOverText is a Component
    final gameOverText = GameOverText(spriteImage);
    // GameOverRestart is a SpriteComponent
    final gameOverButton = GameOverButton(spriteImage);

    add(gameOverText);
    add(gameOverButton);
  }

  @override
  void render(Canvas canvas) {
    if (visible) {
    } // If not visible none of the children will be rendered
  }
}
```

There are two methods for adding child components to your component. First, you have methods
`add()`, `addAll()`, and `addToParent()`, which can be used at any time during the game.
Traditionally, children will be created and added from the component's `onLoad()` method, but it
is also common to add new children during the course of the game.

The second method is to use the `children:` parameter in the component's constructor. This
approach more closely resembles the standard Flutter API:

```dart
class MyGame extends FlameGame {
  @override
  void onLoad() {
    add(
      PositionComponent(
        position: Vector2(30, 0),
        children: [
          HighScoreDisplay(),
          HitPointsDisplay(),
          FpsComponent(),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

The two approaches can be combined freely: the children specified within the constructor will be
added first, and then any additional child components after.

Note that the children added via either method are only guaranteed to be available eventually:
after they are loaded and mounted. We can only assure that they will appear in the children list
in the same order as they were scheduled for addition.

### Access to the World from a Component

If a component that has a `World` as an ancestor and requires access to that `World` object, one
can use the `HasWorldReference` mixin.

Example:

```dart
class MyComponent extends Component with HasWorldReference<MyWorld>,
    TapCallbacks {
  @override
  void onTapDown(TapDownEvent info) {
    // world is of type MyWorld
    world.add(AnotherComponent());
  }
}
```

If you try to access `world` from a component that doesn't have a `World` ancestor of the
correct type an assertion error will be thrown.

### Ensuring a component has a given parent

When a component needs to be added to a specific parent type, the `ParentIsA` mixin can be used
to enforce a strongly typed parent.

Example:

```dart
class MyComponent extends Component with ParentIsA<MyParentComponent> {
  @override
  void onLoad() {
    // parent is of type MyParentComponent
    print(parent.myValue);
  }
}
```

If you try to add `MyComponent` to a parent that is not `MyParentComponent`, an assertion error
will be thrown.

### Ensuring a component has a given ancestor

When a component needs to have a specific ancestor type somewhere in the component tree, the
`HasAncestor` mixin can be used to enforce that relationship.

The mixin exposes the `ancestor` field that will be of the given type.

Example:

```dart
class MyComponent extends Component with HasAncestor<MyAncestorComponent> {
  @override
  void onLoad() {
    // ancestor is of type MyAncestorComponent.
    print(ancestor.myValue);
  }
}
```

If you try to add `MyComponent` to a tree that does not contain `MyAncestorComponent`, an
assertion error will be thrown.

### Component Keys

Components can have an identification key that allows them to be retrieved from the component
tree, from any point of the tree.

To register a component with a key, simply pass a key to the `key` argument on the component's
constructor:

```dart
final myComponent = Component(
  key: ComponentKey.named('player'),
);
```

Then, to retrieve it in a different point of the component tree:

```dart
flameGame.findByKey(ComponentKey.named('player'));
```

There are two types of keys, `unique` and `named`. Unique keys are based on equality of the key
instance, meaning that:

```dart
final key = ComponentKey.unique();
final key2 = key;
print(key == key2); // true
print(key == ComponentKey.unique()); // false
```

Named ones are based on the name that it receives, so:

```dart
final key1 = ComponentKey.named('player');
final key2 = ComponentKey.named('player');
print(key1 == key2); // true
```

When named keys are used, the `findByKeyName` helper can also be used to retrieve the component.

```dart
flameGame.findByKeyName('player');
```

### Querying child components

The children that have been added to a component live in a `QueryableOrderedSet` called
`children`. To query for a specific type of components in the set, the `query<T>()` function can be
used. By default `strictMode` is `false` in the children set, but if you set it to true, then the
queries will have to be registered with `children.register` before a query can be used.

If you know at compile time that you later will run a query of a specific type it is recommended to
register the query, no matter if the `strictMode` is set to `true` or `false`, since there are some
performance benefits to gain from it. The `register` call is usually done in `onLoad`.

Example:

```dart
@override
void onLoad() {
  children.register<PositionComponent>();
}
```

In the example above a query is registered for `PositionComponent`s, and an example of how to
query the registered component type can be seen below.

```dart
@override
void update(double dt) {
  final allPositionComponents = children.query<PositionComponent>();
}
```

### Querying components at a specific point on the screen

The method `componentsAtPoint()` allows you to check which components were rendered at some point
on the screen. The returned value is an iterable of components, but you can also obtain the
coordinates of the initial point in each component's local coordinate space by providing a writable
`List<Vector2>` as a second parameter.

The iterable retrieves the components in the front-to-back order, i.e. first the components in
the front, followed by the components in the back.

This method can only return components that implement the method `containsLocalPoint()`. The
`PositionComponent` (which is the base class for many components in Flame) provides such an
implementation. However, if you're defining a custom class that derives from `Component`, you'd have
to implement the `containsLocalPoint()` method yourself.

Here is an example of how `componentsAtPoint()` can be used:

```dart
void onDragUpdate(DragUpdateInfo info) {
  game.componentsAtPoint(info.widget).forEach((component) {
    if (component is DropTarget) {
      component.highlight();
    }
  });
}
```

### Visibility of components

The recommended way to hide or show a component is usually to add or remove it from the tree using
the `add` and `remove` methods.

However, adding and removing components from the tree will trigger lifecycle steps for that
component (such as calling `onRemove` and `onMount`). It is also an asynchronous process and care
needs to be taken to ensure the component has finished removing before it is added again if you
are removing and adding a component in quick succession.

```dart
/// Example of handling the removal and adding of a child component
/// in quick succession
void show() async {
  // Need to await the [removed] future first, just in case the
  // component is still in the process of being removed.
  await myChildComponent.removed;
  add(myChildComponent);
}

void hide() {
  remove(myChildComponent);
}
```

These behaviors are not always desirable.

An alternative method to show and hide a component is to use the `HasVisibility` mixin, which may
be used on any class that inherits from `Component`. This mixin introduces the `isVisible` property.
Simply set `isVisible` to `false` to hide the component, and `true` to show it again, without
removing it from the tree. This affects the visibility of the component and all its descendants
(children).

```dart
/// Example that implements HasVisibility
class MyComponent extends PositionComponent with HasVisibility {}

/// Usage of the isVisible property
final myComponent = MyComponent();
add(myComponent);

myComponent.isVisible = false;
```

The mixin only affects whether the component is rendered, and will not affect other behaviors.

```{note}
Important! Even when the component is not visible, it is still in the tree and
will continue to receive calls to 'update' and all other lifecycle events. It
will still respond to input events, and will still interact with other
components, such as collision detection for example.
```

The mixin works by preventing the `renderTree` method, therefore if `renderTree` is being
overridden, a manual check for `isVisible` should be included to retain this functionality.

```dart
class MyComponent extends PositionComponent with HasVisibility {

  @override
  void renderTree(Canvas canvas) {
    // Check for visibility
    if (isVisible) {
      // Custom code here

      // Continue rendering the tree
      super.renderTree(canvas);
    }
  }
}
```

### Render Contexts

If you want a parent component to pass render-specific properties down to its children tree, you
can override the `renderContext` property on the parent component. You can return a custom class
that inherits from `RenderContext`, and then use `findRenderContext` on the children while
rendering. Render Contexts are stored as a stack and propagated whenever the render tree is
navigated for rendering.

For example:

```dart
class IntContext extends ComponentRenderContext {
  int value;

  IntContext(this.value);
}

class ParentWithContext extends Component {
  @override
  IntContext renderContext = IntContext(42);
}

class ChildReadsContext extends Component {
  @override
  void render(Canvas canvas) {
    final context = findRenderContext<IntContext>();
    // context.value available
  }
}
```

Each component will have access to the context of any parent that is above it in the component
tree. If multiple components add the contexts matching the selected type `T`, the "closest" one
will be returned (though typically you would create a unique context type for each component).

## Effects

Flame provides a set of effects that can be applied to a certain type of components. These effects
can be used to animate some properties of your components, like position or dimensions. You can
check the [list of available effects](../effects/effects.md).

Examples of the running effects can be found in the
[effects examples directory](https://github.com/flame-engine/flame/tree/main/examples/lib/stories/effects).

# ParallaxComponent

Parallax scrolling is a classic game development technique where background layers move at different
speeds to create an illusion of depth. Objects closer to the camera appear to move faster than those
far away. Just as when looking out a car window, nearby trees fly by while distant mountains barely
move. This effect makes 2D game worlds feel more immersive and is commonly used in side-scrollers,
platformers, and menu screens.

This `Component` can be used to render backgrounds with a depth feeling by drawing several
transparent images on top of each other, where each image or animation (`ParallaxRenderer`) is
moving with a different velocity.

The simplest `ParallaxComponent` is created like this:

```dart
@override
Future<void> onLoad() async {
  final parallaxComponent = await loadParallaxComponent([
    ParallaxImageData('bg.png'),
    ParallaxImageData('trees.png'),
  ]);
  add(parallaxComponent);
}
```

A ParallaxComponent can also "load itself" by implementing the `onLoad` method:

```dart
class MyParallaxComponent extends ParallaxComponent<MyGame> {
  @override
  Future<void> onLoad() async {
    parallax = await game.loadParallax([
      ParallaxImageData('bg.png'),
      ParallaxImageData('trees.png'),
    ]);
  }
}

class MyGame extends FlameGame {
  @override
  void onLoad() {
    add(MyParallaxComponent());
  }
}
```

This creates a static background. If you want a moving parallax (which is the whole point of a
parallax), you can do it in a few different ways depending on how fine-grained you want to set the
settings for each layer.

The simplest way is to set the named optional parameters `baseVelocity` and
`velocityMultiplierDelta` in the `load` helper function. For example if you want to move your
background images along the X-axis with a faster speed the "closer" the image is:

```dart
@override
Future<void> onLoad() async {
  final parallaxComponent = await loadParallaxComponent(
    _dataList,
    baseVelocity: Vector2(20, 0),
    velocityMultiplierDelta: Vector2(1.8, 1.0),
  );
}
```

You can set the baseSpeed and layerDelta at any time, for example if your character jumps or your
game speeds up.

```dart
@override
void onLoad() {
  final parallax = parallaxComponent.parallax;
  parallax.baseSpeed = Vector2(100, 0);
  parallax.velocityMultiplierDelta = Vector2(2.0, 1.0);
}
```

By default, the images are aligned to the bottom left, repeated along the X-axis and scaled
proportionally so that the image covers the height of the screen. If you want to change this
behavior, for example if you are not making a side-scrolling game, you can set the `repeat`,
`alignment` and `fill` parameters for each `ParallaxRenderer` and add them to `ParallaxLayer`s that
you then pass in to the `ParallaxComponent`'s constructor.

Advanced example:

```dart
final images = [
  loadParallaxImage(
    'stars.jpg',
    repeat: ImageRepeat.repeat,
    alignment: Alignment.center,
    fill: LayerFill.width,
  ),
  loadParallaxImage(
    'planets.jpg',
    repeat: ImageRepeat.repeatY,
    alignment: Alignment.bottomLeft,
    fill: LayerFill.none,
  ),
  loadParallaxImage(
    'dust.jpg',
    repeat: ImageRepeat.repeatX,
    alignment: Alignment.topRight,
    fill: LayerFill.height,
  ),
];

final layers = images.map(
  (image) => ParallaxLayer(
    await image,
    velocityMultiplier: images.indexOf(image) * 2.0,
  )
);

final parallaxComponent = ParallaxComponent.fromParallax(
  Parallax(
    await Future.wait(layers),
    baseVelocity: Vector2(50, 0),
  ),
);
```

- The stars image in this example will be repeatedly drawn in both axes, align in the center and be
  scaled to fill the screen width.
- The planets image will be repeated in Y-axis, aligned to the bottom left of the screen and not be
  scaled.
- The dust image will be repeated in X-axis, aligned to the top right and scaled to fill the screen
  height.

Once you are done setting up your `ParallaxComponent`, add it to the game like with any other
component (`game.add(parallaxComponent`).
Also, don't forget to add your images to the `pubspec.yaml` file as assets or they won't be found.

The `Parallax` file contains an extension of the game which adds `loadParallax`,
`loadParallaxLayer`, `loadParallaxImage` and `loadParallaxAnimation` so that it automatically
uses your game's image cache instead of the global one. The same goes for the `ParallaxComponent`
file, but that provides `loadParallaxComponent`.

If you want a fullscreen `ParallaxComponent` simply omit the `size` argument and it will take the
size of the game, it will also resize to fullscreen when the game changes size or orientation.

Flame provides two kinds of `ParallaxRenderer`: `ParallaxImage` and `ParallaxAnimation`,
`ParallaxImage` is a static image renderer and `ParallaxAnimation` is, as its name implies, an
animation and frame based renderer.
It is also possible to create custom renderers by extending the `ParallaxRenderer` class.

Three example implementations can be found in the
[examples directory](https://github.com/flame-engine/flame/tree/main/examples/lib/stories/parallax).

# PositionComponent

Most visible objects in a game need a position, size, and rotation. `PositionComponent` provides
these transform properties, making it the base class for nearly every visual element in Flame:
sprites, animations, shapes, and your own custom components. It mirrors the concept of a
[`Positioned`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Positioned-class.html) widget in Flutter, but
in a game-oriented coordinate system.

This class represents a positioned object on the screen, be it a floating rectangle, a rotating
sprite, or anything else with position and size. It can also represent a group of positioned
components if children are added to it.

The base of the `PositionComponent` is that it has a `position`, `size`, `scale`, `angle` and
`anchor` which transforms how the component is rendered.

## Position

The `position` is just a `Vector2` which represents the position of the component's anchor in
relation to its parent; if the parent is a `FlameGame`, it is in relation to the viewport.

## Size

The `size` of the component when the zoom level of the camera is 1.0 (no zoom, default).
The `size` is _not_ in relation to the parent of the component.

## Scale

The `scale` is how much the component and its children should be scaled. Since it is represented
by a `Vector2`, you can scale in a uniform way by changing `x` and `y` with the same amount, or in a
non-uniform way, by changing `x` or `y` by different amounts.

## Angle

The `angle` is the rotation angle around the anchor, represented as a double in radians. It is
relative to the parent's angle.

## Native Angle

The `nativeAngle` is an angle in radians, measured clockwise, representing the default orientation
of the component. It can be used to define the direction in which the component is facing when
[angle](#angle) is zero.

It is especially helpful when making a sprite based component look at a specific target. If the
original image of the sprite is not facing in the up/north direction, the calculated angle to make
the component look at the target will need some offset to make it look correct. For such cases,
`nativeAngle` can be used to let the component know what direction the original image is facing.

An example could be a bullet image pointing in the east direction. In this case `nativeAngle` can
be set to pi/2 radians. Following are some common directions and their corresponding native
angle values.

| Direction  | Native Angle | In degrees  |
| ---------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| Up/North   | 0            | 0           |
| Down/South | pi or -pi    | 180 or -180 |
| Left/West  | -pi/2        | -90         |
| Right/East | pi/2         | 90          |

## Anchor

```{flutter-app}
:sources: ../../flame/examples
:page: anchor
:show: widget code infobox
This example shows effect of changing `anchor` point of parent
(red) and child (blue) components. Tap on them to cycle through
the anchor points. Note that the local position of the child
component is (0, 0) at all times.
```

The `anchor` is where on the component that the position and rotation should be defined from (the
default is `Anchor.topLeft`). So if you have the anchor set as `Anchor.center` the component's
position on the screen will be in the center of the component and if an `angle` is applied, it is
rotated around the anchor, so in this case around the center of the component. You can think of it
as the point within the component by which Flame "grabs" it.

When `position` or `absolutePosition` of a component is queried, the returned coordinates are that
of the `anchor` of the component. In case you want to find the position of a specific anchor
point of a component which is not actually the `anchor` of that component, you can use the
`positionOfAnchor` and `absolutePositionOfAnchor` methods.

```dart
final comp = PositionComponent(
  size: Vector2.all(20),
  anchor: Anchor.center,
);

// Returns (0,0)
final p1 = component.position;

// Returns (10, 10)
final p2 = component.positionOfAnchor(Anchor.bottomRight);
```

A common pitfall when using `anchor` is confusing it as being the attachment point for children
components. For example, setting `anchor` to `Anchor.center` for a parent component does not mean
that the children components will be placed w.r.t the center of parent.

```{note}
Local origin for a child component is always the top-left
corner of its parent component, irrespective of their
`anchor` values.
```

## PositionComponent children

All children of the `PositionComponent` will be transformed in relation to the parent, which means
that the `position`, `angle` and `scale` will be relative to the parent's state.
So if you, for example, wanted to position a child in the center of the parent you would do this:

```dart
@override
void onLoad() {
  final parent = PositionComponent(
    position: Vector2(100, 100),
    size: Vector2(100, 100),
  );
  final child = PositionComponent(
    position: parent.size / 2,
    anchor: Anchor.center,
  );
  parent.add(child);
}
```

Remember that most components that are rendered on the screen are `PositionComponent`s, so
this pattern can be used in for example [SpriteComponent](sprite_components.md#spritecomponent)
and [SpriteAnimationComponent](sprite_components.md#spriteanimationcomponent) too.

## Render PositionComponent

When implementing the `render` method for a component that extends `PositionComponent` remember to
render from the top left corner (0.0). Your render method should not handle where on the screen your
component should be rendered. To handle where and how your component should be rendered use the
`position`, `angle` and `anchor` properties and Flame will automatically handle the rest for you.

If you want to know where on the screen the bounding box of the component is you can use the
`toRect` method.

In the event that you want to change the direction of your component's rendering, you can also use
`flipHorizontally()` and `flipVertically()` to flip anything drawn to canvas during
`render(Canvas canvas)`, around the anchor point. These methods are available on all
`PositionComponent` objects, and are especially useful on `SpriteComponent` and
`SpriteAnimationComponent`.

In case you want to flip a component around its center without having to change the anchor to
`Anchor.center`, you can use `flipHorizontallyAroundCenter()` and `flipVerticallyAroundCenter()`.

# ShapeComponents

Geometric shapes are useful in many game scenarios: debug visualizations, procedurally generated
graphics, UI elements, or simple game objects that don't need sprite art. Flame's shape components
let you render polygons, rectangles, and circles as first-class components with all the transform
properties of `PositionComponent`. They also serve as the foundation for the
[collision detection hitboxes](../collision_detection.md#shapehitbox).

A `ShapeComponent` is the base class for representing a scalable geometrical shape. The shapes have
different ways of defining how they look, but they all have a size and angle that can be modified
and the shape definition will scale or rotate the shape accordingly.

These shapes are meant as a tool for using geometrical shapes in a more general way than together
with the collision detection system, where you want to use the
[ShapeHitbox](../collision_detection.md#shapehitbox)es.

## PolygonComponent

A `PolygonComponent` is created by giving it a list of points in the constructor, called vertices.
This list will be transformed into a polygon with a size, which can still be scaled and rotated.

For example, this would create a square going from (50, 50) to (100, 100), with its center in
(75, 75):

```dart
void main() {
  PolygonComponent([
    Vector2(100, 100),
    Vector2(100, 50),
    Vector2(50, 50),
    Vector2(50, 100),
  ]);
}
```

A `PolygonComponent` can also be created with a list of relative vertices, which are points defined
in relation to the given size, most often the size of the intended parent.

For example you could create a diamond-shaped polygon like this:

```dart
void main() {
  PolygonComponent.relative(
    [
      Vector2(0.0, -1.0), // Middle of top wall
      Vector2(1.0, 0.0), // Middle of right wall
      Vector2(0.0, 1.0), // Middle of bottom wall
      Vector2(-1.0, 0.0), // Middle of left wall
    ],
    size: Vector2.all(100),
  );
}
```

The vertices in the example define percentages of the length from the center to the edge of the
screen in both x and y axis, so for our first item in our list (`Vector2(0.0, -1.0)`) we are
pointing on the middle of the top wall of the bounding box, since the coordinate system here is
defined from
the center of the polygon.

![An example of how to define a polygon shape](../../images/polygon_shape.png)

In the image you can see how the polygon shape formed by the purple arrows is defined by the red
arrows.

## RectangleComponent

A `RectangleComponent` is created very similarly to how a `PositionComponent` is created, since it
also has a bounding rectangle.

Something like this for example:

```dart
void main() {
  RectangleComponent(
    position: Vector2(10.0, 15.0),
    size: Vector2.all(10),
    angle: pi/2,
    anchor: Anchor.center,
  );
}
```

Dart also already has an excellent way to create rectangles and that class is called `Rect`, you
can create a Flame `RectangleComponent` from a `Rect` by using the
`RectangleComponent.fromRect` factory, and just like when setting the vertices of the
`PolygonComponent`, your rectangle will be sized
according to the `Rect` if you use this constructor.

The following would create a `RectangleComponent` with its top left corner in `(10, 10)` and a size
of `(100, 50)`.

```dart
void main() {
  RectangleComponent.fromRect(
    Rect.fromLTWH(10, 10, 100, 50),
  );
}
```

You can also create a `RectangleComponent` by defining a relation to the intended parent's size,
you can use the default constructor to build your rectangle from a position, size and angle. The
`relation` is a vector defined in relation to the parent size, for example a `relation` that is
`Vector2(0.5, 0.8)` would create a rectangle that is 50% of the width of the parent's size and
80% of its height.

In the example below a `RectangleComponent` of size `(25.0, 30.0)` positioned at `(100, 100)` would
be created.

```dart
void main() {
  RectangleComponent.relative(
    Vector2(0.5, 1.0),
    position: Vector2.all(100),
    size: Vector2(50, 30),
  );
}
```

Since a square is a simplified version of a rectangle, there is also a constructor for creating a
square `RectangleComponent`, the only difference is that the `size` argument is a `double` instead
of a `Vector2`.

```dart
void main() {
  RectangleComponent.square(
    position: Vector2.all(100),
    size: 200,
  );
}
```

## CircleComponent

If you know your circle's position and/or how long the radius is going to be from the start
you can use the optional arguments `radius` and `position` to set those.

The following would create a `CircleComponent` with its center in `(100, 100)` with a radius of 5,
and therefore a size of `Vector2(10, 10)`.

```dart
void main() {
  CircleComponent(radius: 5, position: Vector2.all(100), anchor: Anchor.center);
}
```

When creating a `CircleComponent` with the `relative` constructor you can define how long the
radius is in comparison to the shortest edge of the bounding box defined by `size`.

The following example would result in a `CircleComponent` that defines a circle with a radius of 40
(a diameter of 80).

```dart
void main() {
  CircleComponent.relative(0.8, size: Vector2.all(100));
}
```

# Sprite Components

Sprites are 2D images (or regions of images) that represent the visual appearance of game objects.
They are the most common way to display characters, items, backgrounds, and other visuals in 2D
games. Flame provides several sprite-based components that make it easy to load images, play
animations, and switch between visual states, all while benefiting from the transform properties
inherited from `PositionComponent`.

## SpriteComponent

The most commonly used implementation of `PositionComponent` is `SpriteComponent`, and it can be
created with a `Sprite`:

```dart
import 'package:flame/components/component.dart';

class MyGame extends FlameGame {
  late final SpriteComponent player;

  @override
  Future<void> onLoad() async {
    final sprite = await Sprite.load('player.png');
    final size = Vector2.all(128.0);
    final player = SpriteComponent(size: size, sprite: sprite);

    // Vector2(0.0, 0.0) by default, can also be set in the constructor
    player.position = Vector2(10, 20);

    // 0 by default, can also be set in the constructor
    player.angle = 0;

    // Adds the component
    add(player);
  }
}
```

## SpriteAnimationComponent

This class is used to represent a Component that has sprites that run in a single cyclic animation.

This will create a simple three frame animation using 3 different images:

```dart
@override
Future<void> onLoad() async {
  final sprites = [0, 1, 2]
      .map((i) => Sprite.load('player_$i.png'));
  final animation = SpriteAnimation.spriteList(
    await Future.wait(sprites),
    stepTime: 0.01,
  );
  this.player = SpriteAnimationComponent(
    animation: animation,
    size: Vector2.all(64.0),
  );
}
```

If you have a sprite sheet, you can use the `sequenced` constructor from the `SpriteAnimationData`
class (check more details on [Images > Animation](../rendering/images.md#animation)):

```dart
@override
Future<void> onLoad() async {
  final size = Vector2.all(64.0);
  final data = SpriteAnimationData.sequenced(
    textureSize: size,
    amount: 2,
    stepTime: 0.1,
  );
  this.player = SpriteAnimationComponent.fromFrameData(
    await images.load('player.png'),
    data,
  );
}
```

All animation components internally maintain a `SpriteAnimationTicker` which ticks the
`SpriteAnimation`. This allows multiple components to share the same animation object.

Example:

```dart
final sprites = [/*Your sprite list here*/];
final animation = SpriteAnimation.spriteList(sprites, stepTime: 0.01);

final animationTicker = SpriteAnimationTicker(animation);

// or alternatively, you can ask the animation object to create one for you.

final animationTicker = animation.createTicker(); // creates a new ticker

animationTicker.update(dt);
```

To listen when the animation is done (when it reaches the last frame and is not looping) you can
use `animationTicker.completed`.

Example:

```dart
await animationTicker.completed;

doSomething();

// or alternatively

animationTicker.completed.whenComplete(doSomething);
```

Additionally, `SpriteAnimationTicker` also has the following optional event callbacks: `onStart`,
`onFrame`, and `onComplete`. To listen to these events, you can do the following:

```dart
final animationTicker = SpriteAnimationTicker(animation)
  ..onStart = () {
    // Do something on start.
  };

final animationTicker = SpriteAnimationTicker(animation)
  ..onComplete = () {
    // Do something on completion.
  };

final animationTicker = SpriteAnimationTicker(animation)
  ..onFrame = (index) {
    if (index == 1) {
      // Do something for the second frame.
    }
  };
```

To reset the animation to the first frame when the component is removed, you can set
`resetOnRemove` to `true`:

```dart
SpriteAnimationComponent(
  animation: animation,
  size: Vector2.all(64.0),
  resetOnRemove: true,
);
```

## SpriteAnimationGroupComponent

`SpriteAnimationGroupComponent` is a simple wrapper around `SpriteAnimationComponent` which enables
your component to hold several animations and change the current playing animation at runtime. Since
this component is just a wrapper, the event listeners can be implemented as described in
[SpriteAnimationComponent](#spriteanimationcomponent).

Its use is very similar to the `SpriteAnimationComponent` but instead of being initialized with a
single animation, this component receives a Map of a generic type `T` as key and a
`SpriteAnimation` as value, and the current animation.

Example:

```dart
enum RobotState {
  idle,
  running,
}

final running = await loadSpriteAnimation(/* omitted */);
final idle = await loadSpriteAnimation(/* omitted */);

final robot = SpriteAnimationGroupComponent<RobotState>(
  animations: {
    RobotState.running: running,
    RobotState.idle: idle,
  },
  current: RobotState.idle,
);

// Changes current animation to "running"
robot.current = RobotState.running;
```

As this component works with multiple `SpriteAnimation`s, naturally it needs an equal number of
animation tickers to make all those animations tick. Use `animationsTickers` getter to access a map
containing tickers for each animation state. This can be useful if you want to register callbacks
for `onStart`, `onComplete` and `onFrame`.

Example:

```dart
enum RobotState { idle, running, jump }

final running = await loadSpriteAnimation(/* omitted */);
final idle = await loadSpriteAnimation(/* omitted */);

final robot = SpriteAnimationGroupComponent<RobotState>(
  animations: {
    RobotState.running: running,
    RobotState.idle: idle,
  },
  current: RobotState.idle,
);

robot.animationTickers?[RobotState.running]?.onStart = () {
  // Do something on start of running animation.
};

robot.animationTickers?[RobotState.jump]?.onStart = () {
  // Do something on start of jump animation.
};

robot.animationTickers?[RobotState.jump]?.onComplete = () {
  // Do something on complete of jump animation.
};

robot.animationTickers?[RobotState.idle]?.onFrame = (currentIndex) {
  // Do something based on current frame index of idle animation.
};
```

## SpriteGroupComponent

`SpriteGroupComponent` is pretty similar to its animation counterpart, but especially for sprites.

Example:

```dart
class PlayerComponent extends SpriteGroupComponent<ButtonState>
    with HasGameReference<SpriteGroupExample>, TapCallbacks {
  @override
  Future<void> onLoad() async {
    final pressedSprite = await game.loadSprite(/* omitted */);
    final unpressedSprite = await game.loadSprite(/* omitted */);

    sprites = {
      ButtonState.pressed: pressedSprite,
      ButtonState.unpressed: unpressedSprite,
    };

    current = ButtonState.unpressed;
  }

  // tap methods handler omitted...
}
```

## IconComponent

`IconComponent` renders a Flutter `IconData` (such as `Icons.star`) as a Flame component. The icon
is rasterized to an image once during `onLoad()` and then drawn each frame using
`canvas.drawImageRect()` with the component's `Paint`. Because the icon is rendered as a cached
image rather than as text, all paint-based effects work out of the box, including `tint()`,
`setOpacity()`, `ColorEffect`, `OpacityEffect`, `GlowEffect`, and custom `ColorFilter`s.

### Basic usage

```dart
import 'package:flame/components.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class MyGame extends FlameGame {
  @override
  Future<void> onLoad() async {
    final star = IconComponent(
      icon: Icons.star,
      iconSize: 64,
      position: Vector2(100, 100),
    );
    add(star);
  }
}
```

### Tinting and effects

The icon is rasterized in white, which allows you to tint it to any color using
`HasPaint` methods:

```dart
// Tint the icon gold
final star = IconComponent(
  icon: Icons.star,
  iconSize: 64,
  position: Vector2(100, 100),
)..tint(const Color(0xFFFFD700));

// Set opacity
star.setOpacity(0.5);

// Or use a custom paint
final icon = IconComponent(
  icon: Icons.favorite,
  iconSize: 48,
  paint: Paint()..colorFilter = const ColorFilter.mode(
    Color(0xFFFF0000),
    BlendMode.srcATop,
  ),
);
```

### Constructor parameters

- `icon`: The `IconData` to render (e.g., `Icons.star`, `Icons.favorite`).
- `iconSize`: The resolution at which the icon is rasterized (default `64`). This is independent
  of the component's display `size`.
- `size`: The display size of the component. Defaults to `Vector2.all(iconSize)` if not provided.
- `paint`: Optional `Paint` for rendering effects.
- All standard `PositionComponent` parameters (`position`, `scale`, `angle`, `anchor`, etc.).

### Changing the icon at runtime

Both the `icon` and `iconSize` properties can be changed after creation. The component will
automatically re-rasterize the icon on the next frame:

```dart
final iconComponent = IconComponent(
  icon: Icons.play_arrow,
  iconSize: 64,
);

// Later, swap the icon
iconComponent.icon = Icons.pause;

// Or change the rasterization resolution
iconComponent.iconSize = 128;
```

# Utility Components

Beyond the core visual components, Flame provides several utility components that handle common
game development tasks: spawning objects over time, rendering tiled maps, clipping render areas,
and bridging Flutter widgets into the game. These components save you from writing boilerplate so
you can focus on game-specific logic.

## SpawnComponent

This component is a non-visual component that spawns other components inside of the parent of the
`SpawnComponent`. It's great if you for example want to spawn enemies or power-ups randomly within
an area.

The `SpawnComponent` takes a factory function that it uses to create new components and an area
where the components should be spawned within (or along the edges of).

For the area, you can use the `Circle`, `Rectangle` or `Polygon` class, and if you want to only
spawn components along the edges of the shape set the `within` argument to false (defaults to true).

This would for example spawn new components of the type `MyComponent` every 0.5 seconds randomly
within the defined circle:

The component supports two types of factories. The `factory` returns a single component and the
`multiFactory` returns a list of components that are added in a single step.

The factory functions take an `int` as an argument, which is the number of components that have
been spawned, so if for example 4 components have been spawned already the 5th call of the factory
method will be called with the `amount=4`, since the counting starts at 0 for the first call.

The `factory` with a single component is for backward compatibility, so you should use the
`multiFactory` if in doubt. A single component `factory` will be wrapped internally to return a
single item list and then used as the `multiFactory`.

If you only want to spawn a certain amount of components, you can use the `spawnCount` argument,
and once the limit is reached the `SpawnComponent` will stop spawning and remove itself.

By default, the `SpawnComponent` will spawn components to its parent, but if you want to spawn
components to another component you can set the `target` argument. Remember that it should be a
`Component` that has a size if you don't use the `area` or `selfPositioning` arguments.

```dart
SpawnComponent(
  factory: (i) => MyComponent(size: Vector2(10, 20)),
  period: 0.5,
  area: Circle(Vector2(100, 200), 150),
);
```

If you don't want the spawning rate to be static, you can use the `SpawnComponent.periodRange`
constructor with the `minPeriod` and `maxPeriod` arguments instead.
In the following example the component would be spawned randomly within the circle and the time
between each new spawned component is between 0.5 to 10 seconds.

```dart
SpawnComponent.periodRange(
  factory: (i) => MyComponent(size: Vector2(10, 20)),
  minPeriod: 0.5,
  maxPeriod: 10,
  area: Circle(Vector2(100, 200), 150),
);
```

If you want to set the position yourself within the `factory` function, you can set
`selfPositioning = true` in the constructors and you will be able to set the positions yourself and
ignore the `area` argument.

```dart
SpawnComponent(
  factory: (i) =>
    MyComponent(position: Vector2(100, 200), size: Vector2(10, 20)),
  selfPositioning: true,
  period: 0.5,
);
```

## SvgComponent

**Note**: To use SVG with Flame, use the [`flame_svg`](https://github.com/flame-engine/flame_svg)
package.

This component uses an instance of `Svg` class to represent a Component that has an SVG that is
rendered in the game:

```dart
@override
Future<void> onLoad() async {
  final svg = await Svg.load('android.svg');
  final android = SvgComponent.fromSvg(
    svg,
    position: Vector2.all(100),
    size: Vector2.all(100),
  );
}
```

## IsometricTileMapComponent

Isometric tile maps are commonly used in strategy, simulation, and RPG games to give a 2D map a
pseudo-3D perspective. This component allows you to render an isometric map based on a cartesian
matrix of blocks and an isometric tileset.

A simple example on how to use it:

```dart
// Creates a tileset, the block ids are automatically assigned sequentially
// starting at 0, from left to right and then top to bottom.
final tilesetImage = await images.load('tileset.png');
final tileset = SpriteSheet(image: tilesetImage, srcSize: Vector2.all(32));
// Each element is a block id, -1 means nothing
final matrix = [[0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]];
add(IsometricTileMapComponent(tileset, matrix));
```

It also provides methods for converting coordinates so you can handle clicks, hovers, render
entities on top of tiles, add a selector, etc.

You can also specify the `tileHeight`, which is the vertical distance between the bottom and top
planes of each cuboid in your tile. Basically, it's the height of the front-most edge of your
cuboid; normally it's half (default) or a quarter of the tile size. On the image below you can see
the height colored in the darker tone:

![An example of how to determine the tileHeight](../../images/tile-height-example.png)

This is an example of what a quarter-length map looks like:

![An example of a isometric map with selector](../../images/isometric.png)

Flame's Example app contains a more in-depth example, featuring how to parse coordinates to make a
selector. The
[source code](https://github.com/flame-engine/flame/blob/main/examples/lib/stories/rendering/isometric_tile_map_example.dart)
is available on GitHub, and a
[live version](https://examples.flame-engine.org/#/Rendering_Isometric_Tile_Map)
can be viewed in the browser.

## NineTileBoxComponent

A Nine Tile Box is a rectangle drawn using a grid sprite.

The grid sprite is a 3x3 grid with 9 blocks, representing the 4 corners, the 4 sides and the
middle.

The corners are drawn at the same size, the sides are stretched on the side direction and the middle
is expanded both ways.

Using this, you can get a box/rectangle that expands well to any sizes. This is useful for making
panels, dialogs, borders.

Check the example app
[nine_tile_box](https://github.com/flame-engine/flame/blob/main/examples/lib/stories/rendering/nine_tile_box_example.dart)
for details on how to use it.

## CustomPainterComponent

A `CustomPainter` is a Flutter class used with the `CustomPaint` widget to render custom
shapes inside a Flutter application.

Flame provides a component that can render a `CustomPainter` called `CustomPainterComponent`. It
receives a custom painter and renders it on the game canvas.

This can be used for sharing custom rendering logic between your Flame game, and your Flutter
widgets.

Check the example app
[custom_painter_component](https://github.com/flame-engine/flame/blob/main/examples/lib/stories/widgets/custom_painter_example.dart)
for details on how to use it.

## ComponentsNotifier

Most of the time just accessing children and their attributes is enough to build the logic of
your game.

But sometimes, reactivity can help the developer to simplify and write better code, to help with
that Flame provides the `ComponentsNotifier`, which is an implementation of a
`ChangeNotifier` that notifies listeners every time a component is added, removed or manually
changed.

For example, let's say that we want to show a game over text when the player's lives reach zero.

To make the component automatically report when new instances are added or removed, the `Notifier`
mixin can be applied to the component class:

```dart
class Player extends SpriteComponent with Notifier {}
```

Then to listen to changes on that component the `componentsNotifier` method from `FlameGame` can
be used:

```dart
class MyGame extends FlameGame {
  int lives = 2;

  @override
  void onLoad() {
    final playerNotifier = componentsNotifier<Player>()
        ..addListener(() {
          final player = playerNotifier.single;
          if (player == null) {
            lives--;
            if (lives == 0) {
              add(GameOverComponent());
            } else {
              add(Player());
            }
          }
        });
  }
}
```

A `Notifier` component can also manually notify its listeners that something changed. Let's expand
the example above to make a HUD component blink when the player has half of their health. In
order to do so, we need the `Player` component to notify a change manually:

```dart
class Player extends SpriteComponent with Notifier {
  double health = 1;

  void takeHit() {
    health -= .1;
    if (health == 0) {
      removeFromParent();
    } else if (health <= .5) {
      notifyListeners();
    }
  }
}
```

Then our hud component could look like:

```dart
class Hud extends PositionComponent with HasGameReference {

  @override
  void onLoad() {
    final playerNotifier = game.componentsNotifier<Player>()
        ..addListener(() {
          final player = playerNotifier.single;
          if (player != null) {
            if (player.health <= .5) {
              add(BlinkEffect());
            }
          }
        });
  }
}
```

`ComponentsNotifier`s can also come in handy to rebuild widgets when state changes inside a
`FlameGame`, to help with that Flame provides a `ComponentsNotifierBuilder` widget.

To see an example of its use, check the
[ComponentsNotifier example](https://github.com/flame-engine/flame/blob/main/examples/lib/stories/components/components_notifier_example.dart).

## ClipComponent

A `ClipComponent` is a component that will clip the canvas to its size and shape. This means that
if the component itself or any child of the `ClipComponent` renders outside of the
`ClipComponent`'s boundaries, the part that is not inside the area will not be shown.

A `ClipComponent` receives a builder function that should return the `Shape` that will define the
clipped area, based on its size.

To make it easier to use that component, there are three factories that offer common shapes:

- `ClipComponent.rectangle`: Clips the area in the form of a rectangle based on its size.
- `ClipComponent.circle`: Clips the area in the form of a circle based on its size.
- `ClipComponent.polygon`: Clips the area in the form of a polygon based on the points received
  in the constructor.

Check the example app
[clip_component](https://github.com/flame-engine/flame/blob/main/examples/lib/stories/components/clip_component_example.dart)
for details on how to use it.

# Anchor Effects

Anchor effects are used to change the anchor point of a component over time. The anchor point is
the point around which the component rotates and scales.

## `AnchorByEffect`

Changes the location of the target's anchor by the specified offset. This effect can also be created
using `AnchorEffect.by()`.

```{flutter-app}
:sources: ../flame/examples
:page: anchor_by_effect
:show: widget code infobox
:width: 180
:height: 160
```

```dart
final effect = AnchorByEffect(
  Vector2(0.1, 0.1),
  EffectController(speed: 1),
);
```

## `AnchorToEffect`

Changes the location of the target's anchor. This effect can also be created using
`AnchorEffect.to()`.

```{flutter-app}
:sources: ../flame/examples
:page: anchor_to_effect
:show: widget code infobox
:width: 180
:height: 160
```

```dart
final effect = AnchorToEffect(
  Anchor.center,
  EffectController(speed: 1),
);
```

# Color Effects

Color effects are used to change the color of a component over time. They can be used to tint a component,
change its opacity, or apply a color filter.

## ColorEffect

This effect will change the base color of the paint, causing the rendered component to be tinted by
the provided color between a provided range.

Usage example:

```{flutter-app}
:sources: ../flame/examples
:page: color_effect
:show: widget code infobox
:width: 180
:height: 160
```

```dart
final effect = ColorEffect(
  const Color(0xFF00FF00),
  EffectController(duration: 1.5),
  opacityFrom: 0.2,
  opacityTo: 0.8,
);
```

The `opacityFrom` and `opacityTo` arguments will determine "how much" of the color that will be
applied to the component. In this example the effect will start with 20% and will go up to 80%.

**Note:** Due to how this effect is implemented, and how Flutter's `ColorFilter` class works, this
effect can't be mixed with other `ColorEffect`s, when more than one is added to the component, only
the last one will have effect.

## `OpacityToEffect`

This effect will change the opacity of the target over time to the specified alpha-value.
It can only be applied to components that implement the `OpacityProvider`.

```{flutter-app}
:sources: ../flame/examples
:page: opacity_to_effect
:show: widget code infobox
:width: 180
:height: 160
```

```dart
final effect = OpacityEffect.to(
  0.2,
  EffectController(duration: 0.75),
);
```

If the component uses multiple paints, the effect can target one more more of those paints
using the `target` parameter. The `HasPaint` mixin implements `OpacityProvider` and exposes APIs
to easily create providers for desired paintIds. For single paintId `opacityProviderOf` can be used
and for multiple paintIds and `opacityProviderOfList` can be used.

```{flutter-app}
:sources: ../flame/examples
:page: opacity_effect_with_target
:show: widget code infobox
:width: 180
:height: 160
```

```dart
final effect = OpacityEffect.to(
  0.2,
  EffectController(duration: 0.75),
  target: component.opacityProviderOfList(
    paintIds: const [paintId1, paintId2],
  ),
);
```

The opacity value of 0 corresponds to a fully transparent component, and the opacity value of 1 is
fully opaque. Convenience constructors `OpacityEffect.fadeOut()` and `OpacityEffect.fadeIn()` will
animate the target into full transparency / full visibility respectively.

## `OpacityByEffect`

This effect will change the opacity of the target relative to the specified alpha-value. For example,
the following effect will change the opacity of the target by `90%`:

```{flutter-app}
:sources: ../flame/examples
:page: opacity_by_effect
:show: widget code infobox
:width: 180
:height: 160
```

```dart
final effect = OpacityEffect.by(
  0.9,
  EffectController(duration: 0.75),
);
```

Currently this effect can only be applied to components that have a `HasPaint` mixin. If the
target component uses multiple paints, the effect can target any individual color using the
`paintId` parameter.

## GlowEffect

```{note}
This effect is currently experimental, and its API may change in the future.
```

This effect will apply the glowing shade around target relative to the specified
`glow-strength`. The color of shade will be targets paint color. For example, the following effect
will apply the glowing shade around target by strength of `10`:

```{flutter-app}
:sources: ../flame/examples
:page: glow_effect
:show: widget code infobox
:width: 180
:height: 160
```

```dart
final effect = GlowEffect(
  10.0,
  EffectController(duration: 3),
);
```

Currently this effect can only be applied to components that have a `HasPaint` mixin.

# Combined Effect

This effect can be used to run multiple other effects simultaneously.

The combined effect can also be alternating (the sequence will first run forward, and then
backward); and also repeat a certain predetermined number of times, or infinitely.

```{flutter-app}
:sources: ../flame/examples
:page: combined_effect
:show: widget code infobox
:width: 450
:height: 350
```

```dart
final effect = CombinedEffect(
  [
    MoveEffect.by(Vector2(200, 0), EffectController(duration: 1)),
    RotateEffect.by(tau / 4, EffectController(duration: 2)),
    ScaleEffect.by(Vector2.all(1.5), EffectController(duration: 1)),
  ],
  alternate: true,
  infinite: true,
);
```

# Effect controllers

An `EffectController` is an object that describes how the effect should evolve over time. If you
think of the initial value of the effect as 0% progress, and the final value as 100% progress, then
the job of the effect controller is to map from the "physical" time, measured in seconds, into the
"logical" time, which changes from 0 to 1.

There are multiple effect controllers provided by the Flame framework:

- [`EffectController`](#effectcontroller)
- [`LinearEffectController`](#lineareffectcontroller)
- [`ReverseLinearEffectController`](#reverselineareffectcontroller)
- [`CurvedEffectController`](#curvedeffectcontroller)
- [`ReverseCurvedEffectController`](#reversecurvedeffectcontroller)
- [`PauseEffectController`](#pauseeffectcontroller)
- [`RepeatedEffectController`](#repeatedeffectcontroller)
- [`InfiniteEffectController`](#infiniteeffectcontroller)
- [`SequenceEffectController`](#sequenceeffectcontroller)
- [`SpeedEffectController`](#speedeffectcontroller)
- [`DelayedEffectController`](#delayedeffectcontroller)
- [`NoiseEffectController`](#noiseeffectcontroller)
- [`RandomEffectController`](#randomeffectcontroller)
- [`SineEffectController`](#sineeffectcontroller)
- [`ZigzagEffectController`](#zigzageffectcontroller)

## `EffectController`

The base `EffectController` class provides a factory constructor capable of creating a variety of
common controllers. The syntax of the constructor is the following:

```dart
EffectController({
    required double duration,
    Curve curve = Curves.linear,
    double? reverseDuration,
    Curve? reverseCurve,
    bool alternate = false,
    double atMaxDuration = 0.0,
    double atMinDuration = 0.0,
    int? repeatCount,
    bool infinite = false,
    double startDelay = 0.0,
    VoidCallback? onMax,
    VoidCallback? onMin,
});
```

- _`duration`_: the length of the main part of the effect, i.e. how long it should take to go
  from 0 to 100%. This parameter cannot be negative, but can be zero. If this is the only parameter
  specified then the effect will grow linearly over the `duration` seconds.

- _`curve`_: if given, creates a non-linear effect that grows from 0 to 100% according to the
  provided [curve](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/animation/Curves-class.html).

- _`reverseDuration`_: if provided, adds an additional step to the controller: after the effect
  has grown from 0 to 100% over the `duration` seconds, it will then go backwards from 100% to 0
  over the `reverseDuration` seconds. In addition, the effect will complete at progress level of 0
  (normally the effect completes at progress 1).

- _`reverseCurve`_: the curve to be used during the "reverse" step of the effect. If not given,
  this will default to `curve.flipped`.

- _`alternate`_: setting this to true is equivalent to specifying the `reverseDuration` equal
  to the `duration`. If the `reverseDuration` is already set, this flag has no effect.

- _`atMaxDuration`_: if non-zero, this inserts a pause after the effect reaches its max
  progress and before the reverse stage. During this time the effect is kept at 100% progress. If
  there is no reverse stage, then this will simply be a pause before the effect is marked as
  completed.

- _`atMinDuration`_: if non-zero, this inserts a pause after the reaches its lowest progress
  (0) at the end of the reverse stage. During this time, the effect's progress is at 0%. If there
  is no reverse stage, then this pause will still be inserted after the "at-max" pause if it's
  present, or after the forward stage otherwise. In addition, the effect will now complete at
  progress level of 0.

- _`repeatCount`_: if greater than one, it will cause the effect to repeat itself the prescribed
  number of times. Each iteration will consists of the forward stage, pause at max, reverse stage,
  then pause at min (skipping those that were not specified).

- _`infinite`_: if true, the effect will repeat infinitely and never reach completion. This is
  equivalent to as if `repeatCount` was set to infinity.

- _`startDelay`_: an additional wait time inserted before the beginning of the effect. This
  wait time is executed only once, even if the effect is repeating. During this time the effect's
  `.started` property returns false. The effect's `onStart()` callback will be executed at the end
  of this waiting period.

  Using this parameter is the simplest way to create a chain of effects that execute one after
  another (or with an overlap).

- _`onMax`_: callback function which will be invoked right after reaching its max progress and
  before the optional pause and reverse stage.

- _`onMin`_: callback function which will be invoked right after reaching its lowest progress
  at the end of the reverse stage and before the optional pause and forward stage.

The effect controller returned by this factory constructor will be composited of multiple simpler
effect controllers described further below. If this constructor proves to be too limited for your
needs, you can always create your own combination from the same building blocks.

In addition to the factory constructor, the `EffectController` class defines a number of properties
common for all effect controllers. These properties are:

- `.started`: true if the effect has already started. For most effect controllers this property
  is always true. The only exception is the `DelayedEffectController` which returns false while the
  effect is in the waiting stage.

- `.completed`: becomes true when the effect controller finishes execution.

- `.progress`: current value of the effect controller, a floating-point value from 0 to 1. This
  variable is the main "output" value of an effect controller.

- `.duration`: total duration of the effect, or `null` if the duration cannot be determined (for
  example if the duration is random or infinite).

## `LinearEffectController`

This is the simplest effect controller that grows linearly from 0 to 1 over the specified
`duration`:

```dart
final controller = LinearEffectController(3);
```

## `ReverseLinearEffectController`

Similar to the `LinearEffectController`, but it goes in the opposite direction and grows linearly
from 1 to 0 over the specified duration:

```dart
final controller = ReverseLinearEffectController(1);
```

## `CurvedEffectController`

This effect controller grows non-linearly from 0 to 1 over the specified `duration` and following
the provided `curve`:

```dart
final controller = CurvedEffectController(0.5, Curves.easeOut);
```

## `ReverseCurvedEffectController`

Similar to the `CurvedEffectController`, but the controller grows down from 1 to 0 following the
provided `curve`:

```dart
final controller = ReverseCurvedEffectController(0.5, Curves.bounceInOut);
```

## `PauseEffectController`

This effect controller keeps the progress at a constant value for the specified time duration.
Typically, the `progress` would be either 0 or 1:

```dart
final controller = PauseEffectController(1.5, progress: 0);
```

## `RepeatedEffectController`

This is a composite effect controller. It takes another effect controller as a child, and repeats
it multiple times, resetting before the start of each next cycle.

```dart
final controller = RepeatedEffectController(LinearEffectController(1), 10);
```

The child effect controller cannot be infinite. If the child is random, then it will be
re-initialized with new random values on each iteration.

## `InfiniteEffectController`

Similar to the `RepeatedEffectController`, but repeats its child controller indefinitely.

```dart
final controller = InfiniteEffectController(LinearEffectController(1));
```

## `SequenceEffectController`

Executes a sequence of effect controllers, one after another. The list of controllers cannot be
empty.

```dart
final controller = SequenceEffectController([
  LinearEffectController(1),
  PauseEffectController(0.2),
  ReverseLinearEffectController(1),
]);
```

## `SpeedEffectController`

Alters the duration of its child effect controller so that the effect proceeds at the predefined
speed. The initial duration of the child EffectController is irrelevant. The child controller must
be the subclass of `DurationEffectController`.

The `SpeedEffectController` can only be applied to effects for which the notion of speed is
well-defined. Such effects must implement the `MeasurableEffect` interface. For example, the
following effects qualify:

- [`MoveByEffect`](move_effects.md#movebyeffect)
- [`MoveToEffect`](move_effects.md#movetoeffect)
- [`MoveAlongPathEffect`](move_effects.md#movealongpatheffect)
- [`RotateEffect.by`](rotate_effects.md#rotateeffectby)
- [`RotateEffect.to`](rotate_effects.md#rotateeffectto)

The parameter `speed` is in units per second, where the notion of a "unit" depends on the target
effect. For example, for move effects, they refer to the distance traveled; for rotation effects
the units are radians.

```dart
final speedController =
    SpeedEffectController(LinearEffectController(0), speed: 1);
final controller =
    EffectController(speed: 1); // same as speedController
```

## `DelayedEffectController`

Effect controller that executes its child controller after the prescribed `delay`. While the
controller is executing the "delay" stage, the effect will be considered "not started", i.e. its
`.started` property will be returning `false`.

```dart
final controller = DelayedEffectController(LinearEffectController(1), delay: 5);
```

## `NoiseEffectController`

This effect controller exhibits noisy behavior, i.e. it oscillates randomly around zero. Such effect
controller can be used to implement a variety of shake effects.

```dart
final controller = NoiseEffectController(duration: 0.6, frequency: 10);
```

## `RandomEffectController`

This controller wraps another controller and makes its duration random. The actual value for the
duration is re-generated upon each reset, which makes this controller particularly useful within
repeated contexts, such as [](#repeatedeffectcontroller) or [](#infiniteeffectcontroller).

```dart
final controller = RandomEffectController.uniform(
  LinearEffectController(0),  // duration here is irrelevant
  min: 0.5,
  max: 1.5,
);
```

The user has the ability to control which `Random` source to use, as well as the exact distribution
of the produced random durations. Two distributions, `.uniform` and `.exponential`, are included,
any other can be implemented by the user.

## `SineEffectController`

An effect controller that represents a single period of the sine function. Use this to create
natural-looking harmonic oscillations. Two perpendicular move effects governed by
`SineEffectControllers` with different periods, will create a [Lissajous curve].

```dart
final controller = SineEffectController(period: 1);
```

## `ZigzagEffectController`

Simple alternating effect controller. Over the course of one `period`, this controller will proceed
linearly from 0 to 1, then to -1, and then back to 0. Use this for oscillating effects where the
starting position should be the center of the oscillations, rather than the extreme (as provided
by the standard alternating `EffectController`).

```dart
final controller = ZigzagEffectController(period: 2);
```

# Effects

In game development, smoothly animating properties over time (moving a character, fading an element,
scaling a power-up) is a constant need. Writing manual interpolation code in every `update` method
is repetitive and error-prone. Effects provide a declarative way to describe these time-based
changes: you attach an effect to a component, and it automatically handles the animation, then
removes itself when finished.

An effect is a special component that can attach to another component in order to modify its
properties or appearance.

For example, suppose you are making a game with collectible power-up items. You want these power-ups
to generate randomly around the map and then de-spawn after some time. Obviously, you could make a
sprite component for the power-up and then place that component on the map, but we could do even
better!

Let's add a `ScaleEffect` to grow the item from 0 to 100% when the power-up first appears. Add
another infinitely repeating alternating `MoveEffect` in order to make the item move slightly up
and down. Then add an `OpacityEffect` that will "blink" the item 3 times, this effect will have a
built-in delay of 30 seconds, or however long you want your power-up to stay in place. Lastly, add
a `RemoveEffect` that will automatically remove the item from the game tree after the specified
time (you probably want to time it right after the end of the `OpacityEffect`).

As you can see, with a few simple effects we have turned a simple lifeless sprite into a much more
interesting item. And what's more important, it didn't result in an increased code complexity: the
effects, once added, will work automatically, and then self-remove from the game tree when
finished.

## Overview

The function of an `Effect` is to effect a change over time in some component's property. In order
to achieve that, the `Effect` must know the initial value of the property, the final value, and how
it should progress over time. The initial value is usually determined by an effect automatically,
the final value is provided by the user explicitly, and progression over time is handled by
[EffectControllers](effect_controllers.md).

### Effect

The base `Effect` class is not usable on its own (it is abstract), but it provides some common
functionality inherited by all other effects. This includes:

- The ability to pause/resume the effect using `effect.pause()` and `effect.resume()`. You can
  check whether the effect is currently paused using `effect.isPaused`.

- Property `removeOnFinish` (which is true by default) will cause the effect component to be
  removed from the game tree and garbage-collected once the effect completes. Set this to false
  if you plan to reuse the effect after it is finished.

- Optional user-provided `onComplete`, which will be invoked when the effect has just
  completed its execution but before it is removed from the game.

- A `completed` future that completes when the effect finishes.

- The `reset()` method reverts the effect to its original state, allowing it to run once again.

There are multiple pre-built effects provided by Flame, and you can also
[create your own](#creating-new-effects). The following effects are included:

- [`MoveByEffect`](move_effects.md#movebyeffect)
- [`MoveToEffect`](move_effects.md#movetoeffect)
- [`MoveAlongPathEffect`](move_effects.md#movealongpatheffect)
- [`RotateAroundEffect`](rotate_effects.md#rotatearoundeffect)
- [`RotateEffect.by`](rotate_effects.md#rotateeffectby)
- [`RotateEffect.to`](rotate_effects.md#rotateeffectto)
- [`ScaleEffect.by`](scale_effects.md#scaleeffectby)
- [`ScaleEffect.to`](scale_effects.md#scaleeffectto)
- [`SizeEffect.by`](size_effects.md#sizeeffectby)
- [`SizeEffect.to`](size_effects.md#sizeeffectto)
- [`AnchorByEffect`](anchor_effects.md#anchorbyeffect)
- [`AnchorToEffect`](anchor_effects.md#anchortoeffect)
- [`OpacityToEffect`](color_effects.md#opacitytoeffect)
- [`OpacityByEffect`](color_effects.md#opacitybyeffect)
- [`ColorEffect`](color_effects.md#coloreffect)
- [`SequenceEffect`](sequence_effect.md)
- [`CombinedEffect`](combined_effect.md)
- [`RemoveEffect`](remove_effect.md)
- [`FunctionEffect`](function_effect.md)

## Creating new effects

Although Flame provides a wide array of built-in effects, eventually you may find them to be
insufficient. Luckily, creating new effects is very simple.

Each effect extends the base `Effect` class, possibly via one of the more specialized abstract
subclasses such as `ComponentEffect<T>` or `Transform2DEffect`.

The `Effect` class' constructor requires an `EffectController` instance as an argument. In most
cases you may want to pass that controller from your own constructor. Luckily, the effect controller
encapsulates much of the complexity of an effect's implementation, so you don't need to worry about
re-creating that functionality.

Lastly, you will need to implement a single method `apply(double progress)` that will be called at
each update tick while the effect is active. In this method you are supposed to make changes to the
target of your effect.

In addition, you may want to implement callbacks `onStart()` and `onFinish()` if there are any
actions that must be taken when the effect starts or ends.

When implementing the `apply()` method we recommend to use relative updates only. That is, change
the target property by incrementing/decrementing its current value, rather than directly setting
that property to a fixed value. This way multiple effects would be able to act on the same component
without interfering with each other.

# Function Effect

The `FunctionEffect` class is a very generic Effect that allows you to do almost anything without
having to define a new effect.

It runs a function that takes the target and the progress of the effect and then the user can
decide what to do with that input.

This could for example be used to make game state changes that happen over time, but that isn't
necessarily visual, like most other effects are.

In the following example we have a `PlayerState` enum that we want to change over time. We want to
change the state to `yawn` when the progress is over 50% and then back to `idle` when the progress
is over 80%.

```dart
enum PlayerState {
  idle,
  yawn,
}

final effect = FunctionEffect<SpriteAnimationGroupComponent<PlayerState>>(
  (target, progress) {
    if (progress > 0.5) {
      target.current = PlayerState.yawn;
    } else if(progress > 0.8) {
      target.current = PlayerState.idle;
    }
  },
  EffectController(
    duration: 10,
    infinite: true,
  ),
);
```

# Move Effects

Move Effects are a special type of effects that modify the position of a component over time, if
you want to for example move your character from one point to another, make it jump, or follow a
path, then you can use one of the predefined move effects.

## `MoveByEffect`

This effect applies to a `PositionComponent` and shifts it by a prescribed `offset` amount. This
offset is relative to the current position of the target:

```{flutter-app}
:sources: ../flame/examples
:page: move_by_effect
:show: widget code infobox
:width: 180
:height: 160
```

```dart
final effect = MoveByEffect(
  Vector2(0, -10),
  EffectController(duration: 0.5),
);
```

If the component is currently at `Vector2(250, 200)`, then at the end of the effect its position
will be `Vector2(250, 190)`.

Multiple move effects can be applied to a component at the same time. The result will be the
superposition of all the individual effects.

## `MoveToEffect`

This effect moves a `PositionComponent` from its current position to the specified destination
point in a straight line.

```{flutter-app}
:sources: ../flame/examples
:page: move_to_effect
:show: widget code infobox
:width: 180
:height: 160
```

```dart
final effect = MoveToEffect(
  Vector2(100, 500),
  EffectController(duration: 3),
);
```

It is possible, but not recommended to attach multiple such effects to the same component.

## `MoveAlongPathEffect`

This effect moves a `PositionComponent` along the specified path relative to the component's
current position. The path can have non-linear segments, but must be singly connected. It is
recommended to start a path at `Vector2.zero()` in order to avoid sudden jumps in the component's
position.

```{flutter-app}
:sources: ../flame/examples
:page: move_along_path_effect
:show: widget code infobox
:width: 180
:height: 160
```

```dart
final effect = MoveAlongPathEffect(
  Path()..quadraticBezierTo(100, 0, 50, -50),
  EffectController(duration: 1.5),
);
```

An optional flag `absolute: true` will declare the path within the effect as absolute. That is, the
target will "jump" to the beginning of the path at start, and then follow that path as if it was a
curve drawn on the canvas.

Another flag `oriented: true` instructs the target not only move along the curve, but also rotate
itself in the direction the curve is facing at each point. With this flag the effect becomes both
the move- and the rotate- effect at the same time.

# Remove Effect

This is a simple effect that can be attached to a component causing it to be removed from the game
tree after the specified delay has passed:

```{flutter-app}
:sources: ../flame/examples
:page: remove_effect
:show: widget code infobox
:width: 180
:height: 160
```

```dart
component.add(RemoveEffect(delay: 3.0));
```

## File: flame/effects/rotate_effects.md

---

# Rotate Effects

Rotate effects are used to change the orientation of a component over time. They can be used to make
a component spin, turn towards a target, or rotate around a point. The rotation is specified in
radians, and the effects can be applied to any component that has a rotation property, such as the
`PositionComponent`.

## `RotateEffect.by`

Rotates the target clockwise by the specified angle relative to its current orientation. The angle
is in radians. For example, the following effect will rotate the target 90º (=[tau]/4 in radians)
clockwise:

```{flutter-app}
:sources: ../flame/examples
:page: rotate_by_effect
:show: widget code infobox
:width: 180
:height: 160
```

```dart
final effect = RotateEffect.by(
  tau/4,
  EffectController(duration: 2),
);
```

## `RotateEffect.to`

Rotates the target clockwise to the specified angle. For example, the following will rotate the
target to look east (0º is north, 90º=[tau]/4 east, 180º=tau/2 south, and 270º=tau\*3/4 west):

```{flutter-app}
:sources: ../flame/examples
:page: rotate_to_effect
:show: widget code infobox
:width: 180
:height: 160
```

```dart
final effect = RotateEffect.to(
  tau/4,
  EffectController(duration: 2),
);
```

## `RotateAroundEffect`

Rotates the target clockwise by the specified angle relative to its current orientation around
the specified center. The angle is in radians. For example, the following effect will rotate the
target 90º (=[tau]/4 in radians) clockwise around (100, 100).

```{flutter-app}
:sources: ../flame/examples
:page: rotate_around_effect
:show: widget code infobox
:width: 180
:height: 160
```

```dart
final effect = RotateAroundEffect(
  tau/4,
  center: Vector2(100, 100),
  EffectController(duration: 2),
);
```

## File: flame/effects/scale_effects.md

---

# Scale Effects

Scale effects are used to change the scale of a component over time. They can be used to make a
component grow, shrink, or change its scale in a specific direction. The scale is specified as a
`Vector2` value, where each x represents the width factor and y represents the height factor. The
effects can be applied to any component that has a scale property, such as the `PositionComponent`.
The difference between size effects and scale effects is that size only changes the size of the
target component, while scale changes the "size" of all children too.

## `ScaleEffect.by`

This effect will change the target's scale by the specified amount. For example, this will cause
the component to grow 50% larger:

```{flutter-app}
:sources: ../flame/examples
:page: scale_by_effect
:show: widget code infobox
:width: 180
:height: 160
```

```dart
final effect = ScaleEffect.by(
  Vector2.all(1.5),
  EffectController(duration: 0.3),
);
```

## `ScaleEffect.to`

This effect works similar to `ScaleEffect.by`, but sets the absolute value of the target's scale.

```{flutter-app}
:sources: ../flame/examples
:page: scale_to_effect
:show: widget code infobox
:width: 180
:height: 160
```

```dart
final effect = ScaleEffect.to(
  Vector2.all(0.5),
  EffectController(duration: 0.5),
);
```

---

## File: flame/effects/sequence_effect.md

---

# Sequence Effect

This effect can be used to run multiple other effects one after another. The constituent effects
may have different types.

The sequence effect can also be alternating (the sequence will first run forward, and then
backward); and also repeat a certain predetermined number of times, or infinitely.

```{flutter-app}
:sources: ../flame/examples
:page: sequence_effect
:show: widget code infobox
:width: 180
:height: 160
```

```dart
final effect = SequenceEffect([
  ScaleEffect.by(
    Vector2.all(1.5),
    EffectController(
      duration: 0.2,
      alternate: true,
    ),
  ),
  MoveEffect.by(
    Vector2(30, -50),
    EffectController(
      duration: 0.5,
    ),
  ),
  OpacityEffect.to(
    0,
    EffectController(
      duration: 0.3,
    ),
  ),
  RemoveEffect(),
]);
```

## File: flame/effects/size_effects.md

---

# Size Effects

Size effects are used to change the size of a component over time. They can be used to make a
component grow, shrink, or change its size in a specific direction. The size is specified as a
`Vector2` value, where x represents the width and y represents the height. The effects can be
applied to any component that implements the `SizeProvider` interface, such as the
`PositionComponent`. The difference between size effects and scale effects is that size only
changes the size of the target component, while scale changes the "size" of all children too.

## `SizeEffect.by`

This effect will change the size of the target component, relative to its current size. For example,
if the target has size `Vector2(100, 100)`, then after the following effect is applied and runs its
course, the new size will be `Vector2(120, 50)`:

```{flutter-app}
:sources: ../flame/examples
:page: size_by_effect
:show: widget code infobox
:width: 180
:height: 160
```

```dart
final effect = SizeEffect.by(
   Vector2(-15, 30),
   EffectController(duration: 1),
);
```

The size of a `PositionComponent` cannot be negative. If an effect attempts to set the size to a
negative value, the size will be clamped at zero.

Note that for this effect to work, the target component must implement the `SizeProvider` interface
and take its `size` into account when rendering. Only few of the built-in components implement this
API, but you can always make your own component work with size effects by adding
`implements SizeEffect` to the class declaration.

An alternative to `SizeEffect` is the `ScaleEffect`, which works more generally and scales both the
target component and its children.

## `SizeEffect.to`

Changes the size of the target component to the specified size. Target size cannot be negative:

```{flutter-app}
:sources: ../flame/examples
:page: size_to_effect
:show: widget code infobox
:width: 180
:height: 160
```

```dart
final effect = SizeEffect.to(
  Vector2(90, 80),
  EffectController(duration: 1),
);
```

## File: flame/inputs/drag_events.md

# Drag Events

**Drag events** occur when the user moves their finger across the screen of the device, or when they
move the mouse while holding its button down.

Multiple drag events can occur at the same time, if the user is using multiple fingers. Such cases
will be handled correctly by Flame, and you can even keep track of the events by using their
`pointerId` property.

For those components that you want to respond to drags, add the `DragCallbacks` mixin.

- This mixin adds four overridable methods to your component: `onDragStart`, `onDragUpdate`,
  `onDragEnd`, and `onDragCancel`. By default, these methods do nothing; they need to be overridden
  in order to perform any function.
- In addition, the component must implement the `containsLocalPoint()` method (already implemented
  in `PositionComponent`, so most of the time you don't need to do anything here). This method
  allows Flame to know whether the event occurred within the component or not.

```dart
class MyComponent extends PositionComponent with DragCallbacks {
  MyComponent() : super(size: Vector2(180, 120));

   @override
   void onDragStart(DragStartEvent event) {
     // Do something in response to a drag event
   }
}
```

## Demo

In this example you can use drag gestures to either drag star-like shapes across the screen, or to
draw curves inside the magenta rectangle.

```{flutter-app}
:sources: ../flame/examples
:page: drag_events
:show: widget code
```

## Drag anatomy

### onDragStart

This is the first event that occurs in a drag sequence. Usually, the event will be delivered to the
topmost component at the point of touch with the `DragCallbacks` mixin. However, by setting the flag
`event.continuePropagation` to true, you can allow the event to propagate to the components below.

The `DragStartEvent` object associated with this event will contain the coordinate of the point
where the event has originated. This point is available in multiple coordinate system:
`devicePosition` is given in the coordinate system of the entire device, `canvasPosition` is in the
coordinate system of the game widget, and `localPosition` provides the position in the component's
local coordinate system.

Any component that receives `onDragStart` will later be receiving `onDragUpdate` and `onDragEnd`
events as well.

### onDragUpdate

This event is fired continuously as user drags their finger across the screen. It will not fire if
the user is holding their finger still.

The default implementation delivers this event to all the components that received the previous
`onDragStart` with the same pointer id. If the point of touch is still within the component, then
`event.localPosition` will give the position of that point in the local coordinate system. However,
if the user moves their finger away from the component, the property `event.localPosition` will
return a point whose coordinates are NaNs. Likewise, the `event.renderingTrace` in this case will be
empty. However, the `canvasPosition` and `devicePosition` properties of the event will be valid.

In addition, the `DragUpdateEvent` will contain `delta`, the amount the finger has moved since
the previous `onDragUpdate`, or since the `onDragStart` if this is the first drag-update after
a drag-start.

The `event.timestamp` property measures the time elapsed since the beginning of the drag. It can be
used, for example, to compute the speed of the movement.

### onDragEnd

This event is fired when the user lifts their finger and thus stops the drag gesture. There is no
position associated with this event.

### onDragCancel

The precise semantics when this event occurs is not clear, so we provide a default implementation
which simply converts this event into an `onDragEnd`.

## Mixins

### DragCallbacks

The `DragCallbacks` mixin can be added to any `Component` in order for that component to start
receiving drag events.

This mixin adds methods `onDragStart`, `onDragUpdate`, `onDragEnd`, and `onDragCancel` to the
component, which by default don't do anything, but can be overridden to implement any real
functionality.

Another crucial detail is that a component will only receive drag events that originate _within_
that component, as judged by the `containsLocalPoint()` function. The commonly-used
`PositionComponent` class provides such an implementation based on its `size` property. Thus, if
your component derives from a `PositionComponent`, then make sure that you set its size correctly.
If, however, your component derives from the bare `Component`, then the `containsLocalPoint()`
method must be implemented manually.

If your component is a part of a larger hierarchy, then it will only receive drag events if its
ancestors have all implemented the `containsLocalPoint` correctly.

```dart
class MyComponent extends PositionComponent with DragCallbacks {
  MyComponent({super.size});

  final _paint = Paint();
  bool _isDragged = false;

  @override
  void onDragStart(DragStartEvent event) => _isDragged = true;

  @override
  void onDragUpdate(DragUpdateEvent event) => position += event.delta;

  @override
  void onDragEnd(DragEndEvent event) => _isDragged = false;

  @override
  void render(Canvas canvas) {
    _paint.color = _isDragged? Colors.red : Colors.white;
    canvas.drawRect(size.toRect(), _paint);
  }
}
```

# Gesture Input

This is documentation for gesture inputs attached directly on the game class, most of the time you
want to detect input on your components instead, see for example the [TapCallbacks](tap_events.md)
and [DragCallbacks](drag_events.md) for that.

For other input documents, see also:

- [Keyboard Input](keyboard_input.md): for keystrokes
- [Other Inputs](other_inputs.md): For joysticks, game pads, etc.

## Intro

Inside `package:flame/gestures.dart` you can find a whole set of `mixin`s which can be included on
your game class instance to be able to receive touch input events. Below you can see the full list
of these `mixin`s and its methods:

## Touch and mouse detectors

```text
- TapDetector
  - onTap
  - onTapCancel
  - onTapDown
  - onLongTapDown
  - onTapUp

- SecondaryTapDetector
  - onSecondaryTapDown
  - onSecondaryTapUp
  - onSecondaryTapCancel

- TertiaryTapDetector
  - onTertiaryTapDown
  - onTertiaryTapUp
  - onTertiaryTapCancel

- DoubleTapDetector
  - onDoubleTap

- LongPressDetector
  - onLongPress
  - onLongPressStart
  - onLongPressMoveUpdate
  - onLongPressUp
  - onLongPressEnd

- VerticalDragDetector
  - onVerticalDragDown
  - onVerticalDragStart
  - onVerticalDragUpdate
  - onVerticalDragEnd
  - onVerticalDragCancel

- HorizontalDragDetector
  - onHorizontalDragDown
  - onHorizontalDragStart
  - onHorizontalDragUpdate
  - onHorizontalDragEnd
  - onHorizontalDragCancel

- ForcePressDetector
  - onForcePressStart
  - onForcePressPeak
  - onForcePressUpdate
  - onForcePressEnd

- PanDetector
  - onPanDown
  - onPanStart
  - onPanUpdate
  - onPanEnd
  - onPanCancel

- ScaleDetector
  - onScaleStart
  - onScaleUpdate
  - onScaleEnd

- MultiTouchTapDetector
  - onTap
  - onTapCancel
  - onTapDown
  - onTapUp

- MultiTouchDragDetector
  - onReceiveDrag
```

Mouse only events

```text
 - MouseMovementDetector
  - onMouseMove
 - ScrollDetector
  - onScroll
```

It is not possible to mix advanced detectors (`MultiTouch*`) with basic detectors of the same
kind, since the advanced detectors will _always win the gesture arena_ and the basic detectors will
never be triggered. So for example, you can't use both `MultiTouchTapDetector` and `PanDetector`
together, since no events will be triggered for the latter (there is also an assertion for this).

Flame's GestureApi is provided by Flutter's Gesture Widgets, including
[GestureDetector widget](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/GestureDetector-class.html),
[RawGestureDetector widget](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/RawGestureDetector-class.html)
and [MouseRegion widget](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/MouseRegion-class.html), you can
also read more about
[Flutter's gesture system](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/gestures/gestures-library.html).

## PanDetector and ScaleDetector

If you add a `PanDetector` together with a `ScaleDetector` you will be prompted with a quite cryptic
assertion from Flutter that says:

```{note}
Having both a pan gesture recognizer and a scale gesture recognizer is
redundant; scale is a superset of pan.

Just use the scale gesture recognizer.
```

This might seem strange, but `onScaleUpdate` is not only triggered when the scale should be changed,
but for all pan/drag events too. So if you need to use both of those detectors you'll have to handle
both of their logic inside `onScaleUpdate` (+`onScaleStart` and `onScaleEnd`).

For example you could do something like this if you want to move the camera on pan events and zoom
on scale events:

```dart
  void clampZoom() {
    camera.viewfinder.zoom = camera.viewfinder.zoom.clamp(0.05, 3.0);
  }

  late double startZoom;

  @override
  void onScaleStart(_) {
    startZoom = camera.viewfinder.zoom;
  }

  @override
  void onScaleUpdate(ScaleUpdateInfo info) {
    final currentScale = info.scale.global;
    if (!currentScale.isIdentity()) {
      camera.viewfinder.zoom = startZoom * currentScale.y;
      clampZoom();
    } else {
      final zoom = camera.viewfinder.zoom;
      final delta = (info.delta.global..negate()) / zoom;
      camera.moveBy(delta);
    }
  }
```

In the example above the pan events are handled with `info.delta` and the scale events with
`info.scale`, although they are theoretically both from underlying scale events.

This can also be seen in the
[zoom example](https://github.com/flame-engine/flame/blob/main/examples/lib/stories/camera_and_viewport/zoom_example.dart).

## Mouse cursor

It is also possible to change the current mouse cursor displayed on the `GameWidget` region. To do
so the following code can be used inside the `Game` class

```dart
mouseCursor.value = SystemMouseCursors.move;
```

To already initialize the `GameWidget` with a custom cursor, the `mouseCursor` property can be used

```dart
GameWidget(
  game: MouseCursorGame(),
  mouseCursor: SystemMouseCursors.move,
);
```

## Event coordinate system

On events that have positions, like for example `Tap*` or `Drag`, you will notice that the
`eventPosition` attribute includes 2 fields: `global` and `widget`. Below you will find a brief
explanation about each of them.

### global

The position where the event occurred considering the entire screen, same as
`globalPosition` in Flutter's native events.

### widget

The position where the event occurred relative to the `GameWidget` position and size, same as
`localPosition` in Flutter's native events.

## Example

```dart
class MyGame extends FlameGame with TapDetector {
  // Other methods omitted

  @override
  bool onTapDown(TapDownInfo info) {
    print("Player tap down on ${info.eventPosition.widget}");
    return true;
  }

  @override
  bool onTapUp(TapUpInfo info) {
    print("Player tap up on ${info.eventPosition.widget}");
    return true;
  }
}
```

You can also check more complete examples in the
[input examples directory](https://github.com/flame-engine/flame/tree/main/examples/lib/stories/input/).

### GestureHitboxes

The `GestureHitboxes` mixin is used to more accurately recognize gestures on top of your
`Component`s. Say that you have a fairly round rock as a `SpriteComponent` for example, then you
don't want to register input that is in the corner of the image where the rock is not displayed,
since a `PositionComponent` is rectangular by default. Then you can use the `GestureHitboxes` mixin
to define a more accurate circle or polygon (or another shape) for which the input should be within
for the event to be registered on your component.

You can add new hitboxes to the component that has the `GestureHitboxes` mixin just like they are
added in the below `Collidable` example.

More information about how to define hitboxes can be found in the hitbox section of the
[collision detection](../collision_detection.md#shapehitbox) docs.

An example of how to use it can be seen in the
[gesture hitboxes example](https://github.com/flame-engine/flame/blob/main/examples/lib/stories/input/gesture_hitboxes_example.dart).

# Inputs

Games are interactive by nature, so handling player input is essential. Flame provides input
handling that works on all platforms Flutter supports: touch on mobile, mouse and keyboard on
desktop, and
pointer events on the web. These APIs are designed as mixins that you add to your components, so
each component can independently decide which input events it cares about. This is similar to how
Flutter's [GestureDetector](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/GestureDetector-class.html)
works, but adapted for Flame's component tree.

# Keyboard Input

This includes documentation for keyboard inputs.

For other input documents, see also:

- [Gesture Input](gesture_input.md): for mouse and touch pointer gestures
- [Other Inputs](other_inputs.md): For joysticks, game pads, etc.

## Intro

The keyboard API on flame relies on the
[Flutter's Focus widget](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Focus-class.html).

To customize focus behavior, see [Controlling focus](#controlling-focus).

There are two ways a game can react to key strokes; at the game level and at a component level.
For each we have a mixin that can me added to a `Game` or `Component` class.

### Receive keyboard events in a game level

To make a `Game` sub class sensitive to key stroke, mix it with `KeyboardEvents`.

After that, it will be possible to override an `onKeyEvent` method.

This method receives two parameters, first the
[`KeyEvent`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/services/KeyEvent-class.html)
that triggers the callback in the first place. The second is a set of the currently pressed
[`LogicalKeyboardKey`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/services/LogicalKeyboardKey-class.html).

The return value is a
[`KeyEventResult`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/KeyEventResult.html).

`KeyEventResult.handled` will tell the framework that the key stroke was resolved inside of Flame
and skip any other keyboard handler widgets apart of `GameWidget`.

`KeyEventResult.ignored` will tell the framework to keep testing this event in any other keyboard
handler widget apart of `GameWidget`. If the event is not resolved by any handler, the framework
will trigger `SystemSoundType.alert`.

`KeyEventResult.skipRemainingHandlers` is very similar to `.ignored`, apart from the fact that will
skip any other handler widget and will straight up play the alert sound.

Minimal example:

```dart
class MyGame extends FlameGame with KeyboardEvents {
  // ...
  @override
  KeyEventResult onKeyEvent(
    KeyEvent event,
    Set<LogicalKeyboardKey> keysPressed,
  ) {
    final isKeyDown = event is KeyDownEvent;

    final isSpace = keysPressed.contains(LogicalKeyboardKey.space);

    if (isSpace && isKeyDown) {
      if (keysPressed.contains(LogicalKeyboardKey.altLeft) ||
          keysPressed.contains(LogicalKeyboardKey.altRight)) {
        this.shootHarder();
      } else {
        this.shoot();
      }
      return KeyEventResult.handled;
    }
    return KeyEventResult.ignored;
  }
}
```

### Receive keyboard events in a component level

To receive keyboard events directly in components, there is the mixin `KeyboardHandler`.

Similarly to `TapCallbacks` and `DragCallbacks`, `KeyboardHandler` can be mixed into any subclass of
`Component`.

KeyboardHandlers must only be added to games that are mixed with `HasKeyboardHandlerComponents`.

> ⚠️ Note: If `HasKeyboardHandlerComponents` is used, you must remove `KeyboardEvents`
> from the game mixin list to avoid conflicts.

After applying `KeyboardHandler`, it will be possible to override an `onKeyEvent` method.

This method receives two parameters. First the
[`KeyEvent`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/services/KeyEvent-class.html)
that triggered the callback in the first place. The second is a set of the currently pressed
[`LogicalKeyboardKey`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/services/LogicalKeyboardKey-class.html)s.

The returned value should be `true` to allow the continuous propagation of the key event among other
components. To not allow any other component to receive the event, return `false`.

Flame also provides a default implementation called `KeyboardListenerComponent` which can be used
to handle keyboard events. Like any other component, it can be added as a child to a `FlameGame`
or another `Component`:

For example, imagine a `PositionComponent` which has methods to move on the X and Y axis,
then the following code could be used to bind those methods to key events:

```dart
add(
  KeyboardListenerComponent(
    keyUp: {
      LogicalKeyboardKey.keyA: (keysPressed) { ... },
      LogicalKeyboardKey.keyD: (keysPressed) { ... },
      LogicalKeyboardKey.keyW: (keysPressed) { ... },
      LogicalKeyboardKey.keyS: (keysPressed) { ... },
    },
    keyDown: {
      LogicalKeyboardKey.keyA: (keysPressed) { ... },
      LogicalKeyboardKey.keyD: (keysPressed) { ... },
      LogicalKeyboardKey.keyW: (keysPressed) { ... },
      LogicalKeyboardKey.keyS: (keysPressed) { ... },
    },
  ),
);
```

### Controlling focus

On the widget level, it is possible to use the
[`FocusNode`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/FocusNode-class.html) API to control whether
the game is focused or not.

`GameWidget` has an optional `focusNode` parameter that allow its focus to be controlled externally.

By default `GameWidget` has its `autofocus` set to true, which means it will get focused once it is
mounted. To override that behavior, set `autofocus` to false.

For a more complete example, see the
[keyboard input example](https://github.com/flame-engine/flame/blob/main/examples/lib/stories/input/keyboard_example.dart).

## Joystick

Flame provides a component capable of creating a virtual joystick for taking input for your game.
To use this feature, you need to create a `JoystickComponent`, configure it the way you want, and
add it to your game.

Check out the following example to get a better understanding:

```dart
class MyGame extends FlameGame {

  @override
  Future<void> onLoad() async {
    super.onLoad();
    final image = await images.load('joystick.png');
    final sheet = SpriteSheet.fromColumnsAndRows(
      image: image,
      columns: 6,
      rows: 1,
    );
    final joystick = JoystickComponent(
      knob: SpriteComponent(
        sprite: sheet.getSpriteById(1),
        size: Vector2.all(100),
      ),
      background: SpriteComponent(
        sprite: sheet.getSpriteById(0),
        size: Vector2.all(150),
      ),
      margin: const EdgeInsets.only(left: 40, bottom: 40),
    );

    final player = Player(joystick);
    add(player);
    add(joystick);
  }
}

class Player extends SpriteComponent with HasGameReference {
  Player(this.joystick)
    : super(
        anchor: Anchor.center,
        size: Vector2.all(100.0),
      );

  /// Pixels/s
  double maxSpeed = 300.0;

  final JoystickComponent joystick;

  @override
  Future<void> onLoad() async {
    sprite = await game.loadSprite('layers/player.png');
    position = game.size / 2;
  }

  @override
  void update(double dt) {
    if (joystick.direction != JoystickDirection.idle) {
      position.add(joystick.relativeDelta  * maxSpeed * dt);
      angle = joystick.delta.screenAngle();
    }
  }
}
```

In this example, we created the classes `MyGame` and `Player`.
`MyGame` creates a joystick which is passed to the `Player` when the latter is created.
In the `Player` class we act upon the current state of the joystick.

The joystick has a few fields that change depending on what state it is in.

Following fields should be used to know the state of the joystick:

- `intensity`: The percentage [0.0, 1.0] that the knob is dragged from the epicenter to the edge of
  the joystick (or `knobRadius` if that is set).
- `delta`: The absolute amount (defined as a `Vector2`) that the knob is dragged from its epicenter.
- `relativeDelta`: The percentage, presented as a `Vector2`, and direction that the knob is currently
  pulled from its base position to a edge of the joystick.

If you want to create buttons to go with your joystick, check out
[`HudButtonComponent`](#hudbuttoncomponent).

For the complete code on implementing the joystick, check out the
[Joystick Example](https://github.com/flame-engine/flame/blob/main/examples/lib/stories/input/joystick_example.dart).
You can also view the
[JoystickComponent in action](https://examples.flame-engine.org/#/Input_Joystick)
to see a live example of the joystick input function integrated into a game.

For an additional challenge, explore the
[Advanced Joystick Example](https://github.com/flame-engine/flame/blob/main/examples/lib/stories/input/joystick_advanced_example.dart).
See what else the advanced features can do in the
[live demo](https://examples.flame-engine.org/#/Input_Joystick_Advanced).

## HudButtonComponent

A `HudButtonComponent` is a button that can be defined with margins to the edge of the `Viewport`
instead of with a position. It takes two `PositionComponent`s. `button` and `buttonDown`, the first
is used for when the button is idle and the second is shown when the button is being pressed. The
second one is optional if you don't want to change the look of the button when it is pressed, or if
you handle this through the `button` component.

As the name suggests this button is a hud by default, which means that it will be static on your
screen even if the camera for the game moves around. You can also use this component as a non-hud by
setting `hudButtonComponent.respectCamera = true;`.

If you want to act upon the button being pressed (which would be the common thing to do) and released,
you can either pass in callback functions as the `onPressed` and `onReleased` arguments, or you can
extend the component and override `onTapDown`, `onTapUp` and/or `onTapCancel` and implement your
logic there.

## SpriteButtonComponent

A `SpriteButtonComponent` is a button that is defined by two `Sprite`s, one that represents
when the button is pressed and one that represents when the button is released.

## ButtonComponent

A `ButtonComponent` is a button that is defined by two `PositionComponent`s, one that represents
when the button is pressed and one that represents when the button is released. If you only want
to use sprites for the button, use the [](#spritebuttoncomponent) instead, but this component can be
good to use if you for example want to have a `SpriteAnimationComponent` as a button, or anything
else which isn't a pure sprite.

## Gamepad

Flame has a dedicated plugin to support external game controllers (gamepads).
Find more information in the [Gamepads repository](https://github.com/flame-engine/gamepads).

## AdvancedButtonComponent

The `AdvancedButtonComponent` have separate states for each of the different pointer phases.
The skin can be customized for each state and each skin is represented by a `PositionComponent`.

These are the fields that can be used to customize the looks of the `AdvancedButtonComponent`:

- `defaultSkin`: Component that will be displayed by default on the button.
- `downSkin`: Component displayed when the button is clicked or tapped.
- `hoverSkin`: Component displayed when the button is hovered. (desktop and web).
- `defaultLabel`: Component shown on top of skins. Automatically aligned to center.
- `disabledSkin`: Component displayed when button is disabled.
- `disabledLabel`: Component shown on top of skins when button is disabled.

## ToggleButtonComponent

The [ToggleButtonComponent] is an [AdvancedButtonComponent] that can switch between selected
and not selected.

In addition to the already existing skins, the [ToggleButtonComponent] contains the following skins:

- `defaultSelectedSkin`: The component to display when the button is selected.
- `downAndSelectedSkin`: The component that is displayed when the selectable button is selected and
  pressed.
- `hoverAndSelectedSkin`: Hover on selectable and selected button (desktop and web).
- `disabledAndSelectedSkin`: For when the button is selected and in the disabled state.
- `defaultSelectedLabel`: Component shown on top of the skins when button is selected.

## IgnoreEvents mixin

If you don't want a component subtree to receive events, you can use the `IgnoreEvents` mixin.
Once you have added this mixin you can turn off events to reach a component and its descendants by
setting `ignoreEvents = true` (default when the mixin is added), and then set it to `false` when you
want to receive events again.

This can be done for optimization purposes, since all events currently go through the whole
component tree.

# Pointer Events

```{note}
This document describes the new events API. The old (legacy) approach,
which is still supported, is described in [](gesture_input.md).
```

**Pointer events** are Flutter's generalized "mouse-movement"-type events (for desktop or web).

If you want to interact with mouse movement events within your component or game, you can use the
`PointerMoveCallbacks` mixin.

For example:

```dart
class MyComponent extends PositionComponent with PointerMoveCallbacks {
  MyComponent() : super(size: Vector2(80, 60));

  @override
  void onPointerMove(PointerMoveEvent event) {
    // Do something in response to the mouse move (e.g. update coordinates)
  }
}
```

The mixin adds two overridable methods to your component:

- `onPointerMove`: called when the mouse moves within the component
- `onPointerMoveStop`: called once if the component was being hovered and the mouse leaves

By default, each of these methods does nothing, they need to be overridden in order to perform any
function.

In addition, the component must implement the `containsLocalPoint()` method (already implemented in
`PositionComponent`, so most of the time you don't need to do anything here). This method allows
Flame to know whether the event occurred within the component or not.

Note that only mouse events happening within your component will be proxied along. However,
`onPointerMoveStop` will be fired once on the first mouse movement that leaves your component, so
you can handle any exit conditions there.

## HoverCallbacks

If you want to specifically know if your component is being hovered or not, or if you want to hook
into hover enter and exit events, you can use a more dedicated mixin called `HoverCallbacks`.

For example:

```dart
class MyComponent extends PositionComponent with HoverCallbacks {

  MyComponent() : super(size: Vector2(80, 60));

  @override
  void update(double dt) {
    // use `isHovered` to know if the component is being hovered
  }

  @override
  void onHoverEnter() {
    // Do something in response to the mouse entering the component
  }

  @override
  void onHoverExit() {
    // Do something in response to the mouse leaving the component
  }
}
```

Note that you can still listen to the "raw" onPointerMove methods for additional functionality, just
make sure to call the `super` version to enable the `HoverCallbacks` behavior.

## File: flame/inputs/scale_events.md

# Scale Events

**Scale events** occur when the user moves two fingers in a pinch in, or in a pinch out move.
Only one single scale gesture can occur at the same time.

For those components that you want to respond to scale events, add the `ScaleCallbacks` mixin.

- This mixin adds three overridable methods to your component: `onScaleStart`, `onScaleUpdate`,
  `onScaleEnd`. By default, these methods do nothing; they need to be overridden in order to
  perform any function.
- In addition, the component must implement the `containsLocalPoint()` method (already implemented
  in `PositionComponent`, so most of the time you don't need to do anything here). This method
  allows Flame to know whether the event occurred within the component or not.

```dart
class MyComponent extends PositionComponent with ScaleCallbacks {
  MyComponent() : super(size: Vector2(180, 120));

   @override
   void onScaleStart(ScaleStartEvent event) {
     // Do something in response to a scale event
   }
}
```

## Scale anatomy

### onScaleStart

This is the first event that occurs in a scale sequence. Usually, the event will be delivered to the
topmost component at the focal point (the point at the center of the line formed by the two fingers)
with the `ScaleCallbacks` mixin. However, by setting the flag
`event.continuePropagation` to true, you can allow the event to propagate to the components below.

The `ScaleStartEvent` object associated with this event will contain
the coordinate of the first focal point
recognized by the scale gesture recognizer. This point is available in multiple coordinate system:
`devicePosition` is given in the coordinate system of the entire device, `canvasPosition` is in the
coordinate system of the game widget, and `localPosition` provides the position in the component's
local coordinate system.

Any component that receives `onScaleStart` will later be receiving `onScaleUpdate` and `onScaleEnd`
events as well.

### onScaleUpdate

This event is fired continuously as user drags their finger across the screen. It will not fire if
the user is holding their finger still.

The default implementation delivers this event to all the components that received the previous
`onScaleStart`. If the point of touch is still within the component, then
`event.localPosition` will give the position of that point in the local coordinate system. However,
if the user moves their finger away from the component, the property `event.localPosition` will
return a point whose coordinates are NaNs. Likewise, the `event.renderingTrace` in this case will be
empty. However, the `canvasPosition` and `devicePosition` properties of the event will be valid.

In addition, the `ScaleUpdateEvent` will contain `focalPointDelta` --
the amount the focal point has moved since the
previous `onScaleUpdate`, or since the `onScaleStart` if this is the first scale-update after a scale-
start.

The `event.timestamp` property measures the time elapsed since the beginning of the scale. It can be
used, for example, to compute the speed of the movement.

The `event.rotation` property measures the angle of rotation in radians, between the line formed
from the two fingers at the start, and the line formed when this event is called.

The `event.scale` property measures the ratio of length between the line formed
from the two fingers at the start, and the line formed when this event is called.

### onScaleEnd

This event is fired when the user lifts their finger and thus stops the scale gesture. There is no
position associated with this event.

## Mixins

### ScaleCallbacks

The `ScaleCallbacks` mixin can be added to any `Component` in order for that component to start
receiving scale events.

This mixin adds methods `onScaleStart`, `onScaleUpdate`, `onScaleEnd` to the
component, which by default don't do anything, but can be overridden to implement any real
functionality.

Another crucial detail is that a component will only receive scale events that originate _within_
that component, as judged by the `containsLocalPoint()` function. The commonly-used
`PositionComponent` class provides such an implementation based on its `size` property. Thus, if
your component derives from a `PositionComponent`, then make sure that you set its size correctly.
If, however, your component derives from the bare `Component`, then the `containsLocalPoint()`
method must be implemented manually.

If your component is a part of a larger hierarchy, then it will only receive scale events if its
ancestors have all implemented the `containsLocalPoint` correctly.

```dart
class ScaleOnlyRectangle extends RectangleComponent with ScaleCallbacks {
  ScaleOnlyRectangle({
    required Vector2 position,
    required Vector2 size,
    Color color = Colors.blue,
    Anchor anchor = Anchor.center,
  }) : super(
         position: position,
         size: size,
         anchor: anchor,
         paint: Paint()..color = color,
       );

  @override
  Future<void> onLoad() async {
    final text = TextComponent(
      text: 'scale',
      textRenderer: TextPaint(
        style: const TextStyle(fontSize: 25, color: Colors.white),
      ),
      position: size / 2,
      anchor: Anchor.center,
    );
    add(text);
  }

  bool isScaling = false;
  double initialAngle = 0;
  Vector2 initialScale = Vector2.all(1);
  double lastScale = 1.0;

  /// ScaleCallbacks overrides
  @override
  void onScaleStart(ScaleStartEvent event) {
    super.onScaleStart(event);
    isScaling = true;
    initialAngle = angle;
    initialScale = scale;
    lastScale = 1.0;
    debugPrint('Scale started at ${event.devicePosition}');
  }

  @override
  void onScaleUpdate(ScaleUpdateEvent event) {
    super.onScaleUpdate(event);
    // scale rectangle size by pinch
    angle = initialAngle + event.rotation;
    // delta scale since last frame
    if (lastScale == 0) {
      return;
    }
    final scaleDelta = event.scale / lastScale;
    lastScale = event.scale; // update for next frame

    // apply delta gently
    scale *= sqrt(scaleDelta);

    // clamp
    scale.clamp(Vector2.all(0.8), Vector2.all(3));
  }

  @override
  void onScaleEnd(ScaleEndEvent event) {
    super.onScaleEnd(event);
    isScaling = false;
    debugPrint('Scale ended with velocity ${event.velocity}');
  }
}

```

## Scale and drag gestures interactions

A multi drag gesture can sometimes look exactly like a scale gesture.
This is the case for instance, if you try to move two components toward each other at the same time.
If you added both a component using ScaleCallbacks and
one using DragCallbacks (or one using both), this issue will arise.
The Scale gesture will win over the drag gesture
and prevent your user to perform the multi drag gesture as they wanted. This is a limitation
with the current implementation that devs need to be aware of.

# Tap Events

```{note}
This document describes the new events API. The old (legacy) approach,
which is still supported, is described in [](gesture_input.md).
```

**Tap events** are one of the most basic methods of interaction with a Flame game. These events
occur when the user touches the screen with a finger, or clicks with a mouse, or taps with a stylus.
A tap can be "long", but the finger isn't supposed to move during the gesture. Thus, touching the
screen, then moving the finger, and then releasing is not a tap but a drag. Similarly, clicking
a mouse button while the mouse is moving will also be registered as a drag.

Multiple tap events can occur at the same time, especially if the user has multiple fingers. Such
cases will be handled correctly by Flame, and you can even keep track of the events by using their
`pointerId` property.

For those components that you want to respond to taps, add the `TapCallbacks` mixin.

- This mixin adds four overridable methods to your component: `onTapDown`, `onTapUp`,
  `onTapCancel`, and `onLongTapDown`. By default, each of these methods does nothing, they need
  to be overridden in order to perform any function.
- In addition, the component must implement the `containsLocalPoint()` method (already implemented
  in `PositionComponent`, so most of the time you don't need to do anything here). This method
  allows Flame to know whether the event occurred within the component or not.

```dart
class MyComponent extends PositionComponent with TapCallbacks {
  MyComponent() : super(size: Vector2(80, 60));

  @override
  void onTapUp(TapUpEvent event) {
    // Do something in response to a tap event
  }
}
```

## Tap anatomy

### onTapDown

Every tap begins with a "tap down" event, which you receive via the `void onTapDown(TapDownEvent)`
handler. The event is delivered to the first component located at the point of touch that has the
`TapCallbacks` mixin. Normally, the event then stops propagation. However, you can force the event
to also be delivered to the components below by setting `event.continuePropagation` to true.

The `TapDownEvent` object that is passed to the event handler, contains the available information
about the event. For example, `event.localPosition` will contain the coordinate of the event in the
current component's local coordinate system, whereas `event.canvasPosition` is in the coordinate
system of the entire game canvas.

Every component that received an `onTapDown` event will eventually receive either `onTapUp` or
`onTapCancel` with the same `pointerId`.

### onLongTapDown

If the user holds their finger down for some time, "long tap" will be triggered. This event invokes
the `void onLongTapDown(TapDownEvent)` handler on those components that previously received the
`onTapDown` event.

By default, the `.longTapDelay` is set to 300 milliseconds, what may be different of the system
default. You can change this value by setting the `TapConfig.longTapDelay` value.
It may also be useful for specific accessibility needs.

### onTapUp

This event indicates successful completion of the tap sequence. It is guaranteed to only be
delivered to those components that previously received the `onTapDown` event with the same pointer
id.

The `TapUpEvent` object passed to the event handler contains the information about the event, which
includes the coordinate of the event (i.e. where the user was touching the screen right before
lifting their finger), and the event's `pointerId`.

Note that the device coordinates of the tap-up event will be the same (or very close) to the device
coordinates of the corresponding tap-down event. However, the same cannot be said about the local
coordinates. If the component that you're tapping is moving (as they often tend to in games), then
you may find that the local tap-up coordinates are quite different from the local tap-down
coordinates.

In extreme case, when the component moves away from the point of touch, the `onTapUp` event will not
be generated at all: it will be replaced with `onTapCancel`. Note, however, that in this case the
`onTapCancel` will be generated at the moment the user lifts or moves their finger, not at the
moment the component moves away from the point of touch.

### onTapCancel

This event occurs when the tap fails to materialize. Most often, this will happen if the user moves
their finger, which converts the gesture from "tap" into "drag". Less often, this may happen when
the component being tapped moves away from under the user's finger. Even more rarely, the
`onTapCancel` occurs when another widget pops over the game widget, or when the device turns off,
or similar situations.

The `TapCancelEvent` object contains only the `pointerId` of the previous `TapDownEvent` which is
now being canceled. There is no position associated with a tap-cancel.

### Demo

Play with the demo below to see the tap events in action.

The blue-ish rectangle in the middle is the component that has the `TapCallbacks` mixin. Tapping
this component would create circles at the points of touch. Specifically, `onTapDown` event
starts making the circle. The thickness of the circle will be proportional to the duration of the
tap: after `onTapUp` the circle's stroke width will no longer grow. There will be a thin white
stripe at the moment the `onLongTapDown` fires. Lastly, the circle will implode and disappear if
you cause the `onTapCancel` event by moving the finger.

## Mixins

This section describes in more details several mixins needed for tap event handling.

### TapCallbacks

The `TapCallbacks` mixin can be added to any `Component` in order for that component to start
receiving tap events.

This mixin adds methods `onTapDown`, `onLongTapDown`, `onTapUp`, and `onTapCancel` to the component,
which by default don't do anything, but can be overridden to implement any real functionality. There
is no need to override all of them either: for example, you can override only `onTapUp` if you wish
to respond to "real" taps only.

Another crucial detail is that a component will only receive tap events that occur _within_ that
component, as judged by the `containsLocalPoint()` function. The commonly-used `PositionComponent`
class provides such an implementation based on its `size` property. Thus, if your component derives
from a `PositionComponent`, then make sure that you set its size correctly. If, however, your
component derives from the bare `Component`, then the `containsLocalPoint()` method must be
implemented manually.

If your component is a part of a larger hierarchy, then it will only receive tap events if its
parent has implemented the `containsLocalPoint` correctly.

```dart
class MyComponent extends Component with TapCallbacks {
  final _rect = const Rect.fromLTWH(0, 0, 100, 100);
  final _paint = Paint();
  bool _isPressed = false;

  @override
  bool containsLocalPoint(Vector2 point) => _rect.contains(point.toOffset());

  @override
  void onTapDown(TapDownEvent event) => _isPressed = true;

  @override
  void onTapUp(TapUpEvent event) => _isPressed = false;

  @override
  void onTapCancel(TapCancelEvent event) => _isPressed = false;

  @override
  void render(Canvas canvas) {
    _paint.color = _isPressed? Colors.red : Colors.white;
    canvas.drawRect(_rect, _paint);
  }
}
```

### SecondaryTapCallbacks

In addition to the primary tap events (i.e. left mouse button on desktop), Flame also supports
secondary tap events (i.e. right mouse button on desktop). To receive these events, add the
`SecondaryTapCallbacks` mixin to your `PositionComponent`.

```dart
class MyComponent extends PositionComponent with SecondaryTapCallbacks {
  @override
  void onSecondaryTapUp(SecondaryTapUpEvent event) {
    /// Do something
  }

  @override
  void onSecondaryTapCancel(SecondaryTapCancelEvent event) {
    /// Do something
  }

  @override
  void onSecondaryTapDown(SecondaryTapDownEvent event) {
    /// Do something
  }
```

You can extend both `TapCallbacks` and `SecondaryTapCallbacks` in the same component to
receive both primary and secondary tap events.

### DoubleTapCallbacks

Flame also offers a mixin named `DoubleTapCallbacks` to receive a double-tap event from the
component. To start receiving double tap events in a component, add the
`DoubleTapCallbacks` mixin to your `PositionComponent`.

```dart
class MyComponent extends PositionComponent with DoubleTapCallbacks {
  @override
  void onDoubleTapUp(DoubleTapEvent event) {
    /// Do something
  }

  @override
  void onDoubleTapCancel(DoubleTapCancelEvent event) {
    /// Do something
  }

  @override
  void onDoubleTapDown(DoubleTapDownEvent event) {
    /// Do something
  }
```

## Migration

If you have an existing game that uses `Tappable`/`Draggable` mixins, then this section will
describe how to transition to the new API described in this document. Here's what you need to do:

Take all of your components that uses these mixins, and replace them with
`TapCallbacks`/`DragCallbacks`.
The methods `onTapDown`, `onTapUp`, `onTapCancel` and `onLongTapDown` will need to be adjusted
for the new API:

- The argument pair such as `(int pointerId, TapDownDetails details)` was replaced with a single
  event object `TapDownEvent event`.
- There is no return value anymore, but if you need to make a component to pass-through the taps
  to the components below, then set `event.continuePropagation` to true. This is only needed for
  `onTapDown` events; all other events will pass-through automatically.
- If your component needs to know the coordinates of the point of touch, use
  `event.localPosition` instead of computing it manually. Properties `event.canvasPosition` and
  `event.devicePosition` are also available.
- If the component is attached to a custom ancestor then make sure that ancestor also have the
  correct size or implement `containsLocalPoint()`.

# Layout

Positioning game elements manually with pixel coordinates works for simple cases, but quickly
becomes tedious when building HUDs, menus, or any UI that needs to adapt to different screen
sizes. Flame's layout components bring familiar concepts from Flutter's layout system (rows,
columns, padding, alignment) into the game world, so you can arrange components declaratively
rather than calculating positions by hand.

- [Align Component](align_component.md)
- [Row Component](row_component.md)
- [Column Component](column_component.md)
- [Expanded Component](expanded_component.md)

# Debug features

## FlameGame features

Flame provides some debugging features for the `FlameGame` class. These features are enabled when
the `debugMode` property is set to `true` (or overridden to be `true`).
When `debugMode` is enabled, each `PositionComponent` will be rendered with their bounding size, and
have their positions written on the screen. This way, you can visually verify the components
boundaries and positions.

Check out this [working example of the debugging features of the `FlameGame`](https://github.com/flame-engine/flame/blob/main/examples/lib/stories/components/debug_example.dart).

## Devtools extension

If you open the [Flutter DevTools](https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/devtools/overview), you will see a
new tab called "Flame". This tab will show you information about the current game, for example a
visualization of the component tree, the ability to play, pause and step the game, information
about the selected component, and more.

## FPS

The FPS reported from Flame might be a bit lower than what is reported from for example the Flutter
DevTools, depending on which platform you are targeting. The source of truth for how many FPS your
game is running in should be the FPS that we are reporting, since that is what our game loop is
bound by.

### FpsComponent

The `FpsComponent` can be added to anywhere in the component tree and will keep track of how many
FPS that the game is currently rendering in. If you want to display this as text in the game, use
the [](#fpstextcomponent).

### FpsTextComponent

The `FpsTextComponent` is simply a [TextComponent] that wraps an `FpsComponent`, since you most
commonly want to show the current FPS somewhere when the `FpsComponent` is used.

[TextComponent]: ../rendering/text_rendering.md#textcomponent

### ChildCounterComponent

`ChildCounterComponent` is a component that renders the number of children of
type `T` from a component (`target`) every second.
So for example, the following will render the number of `SpriteAnimationComponent` that are
children of the game `world`:

```dart
add(
  ChildCounterComponent<SpriteAnimationComponent>(
    target: world,
  ),
);
```

### TimeTrackComponent

This component allows developers to track time spent inside their code. This can be useful for
performance debugging time spent in certain parts of the code.

To use it, add it to your game somewhere (since this is a debug feature, we advise to only add the
component in a debug build/flavor):

```dart
add(TimeTrackComponent());
```

Then in the code section that you want to track time, do the following:

```dart
void update(double dt) {
  TimeTrackComponent.start('MyComponent.update');
  // ...
  TimeTrackComponent.end('MyComponent.update');
}
```

With the calls above, the added `TimeTrackComponent` will render the elapsed time in
microseconds.

# Performance

Just like any other game engine, Flame tries to be as efficient as possible without making the API
too complex. But given its general purpose nature, Flame cannot make any assumption about the type of
game being made. This means game developers will always have some room for performance optimizations
based on how their game functions.

On the other hand, depending on the underlying hardware, there will always be some hard limit on what
can be achieved with Flame. But apart from the hardware limits, there are some common pitfalls that
Flame users can run into, which can be easily avoided by following some simple steps. This section tries
to cover some optimization tricks and ways to avoid the common performance pitfalls.

```{note}
Disclaimer: Each Flame project is very different from the others. As a result, solution
described here cannot guarantee to always produce a significant improvement in performance.
```

## Object creation per frame

Creating objects of a class is very common in any kind of project/game. But object creation is a somewhat
involved operation. Depending on the frequency and amount of objects that are being created, the application
can experience some slow down.

In games, this is something to be very careful of because games generally have a game loop that
updates as fast as possible, where each update is called a frame. Depending on the hardware, a
game can be updating 30, 60, 120 or even higher frames per second. This means if a new object is
created in a frame, the game will end up creating as many number of objects as the frame count
per second.

Flame users generally tend to run into this problem when they override the `update` and `render`
method of a `Component`. For example, in the following innocent looking code, a new `Vector2` and
a new `Paint` object is spawned every frame. But the data inside the objects is essentially the
same across all frames. Now imagine if there are 100 instances of `MyComponent` in a game running
at 60 FPS. That would essentially mean 6000 (100 \* 60) new instances of `Vector2` and `Paint`
each will be created every second.

```{note}
It is like buying a new computer every time you want to send an email or buying
a new pen every time you want to write something. Sure it gets the job done, but
it is not very economically smart.
```

```dart
class MyComponent extends PositionComponent {
  @override
  void update(double dt) {
    position += Vector2(10, 20) * dt;
  }

  @override
  void render(Canvas canvas) {
    canvas.drawRect(size.toRect(), Paint());
  }
}
```

A better way of doing things would be something like as shown below. This code stores the required `Vector2`
and `Paint` objects as class members and reuses them across all the update and render calls.

```dart
class MyComponent extends PositionComponent {
  final _direction = Vector2(10, 20);
  final _paint = Paint();

  @override
  void update(double dt) {
    position.setValues(
      position.x + _direction.x * dt,
      position.y + _direction.y * dt,
    );
  }

  @override
  void render(Canvas canvas) {
    canvas.drawRect(size.toRect(), _paint);
  }
}
```

```{note}
To summarize, avoid creating unnecessary objects in every frame. Even a seemingly
small object can affect the performance if spawned in high volume.
```

## Unwanted collision checks

Flame has a built-in collision detection system which can detect when any two `Hitbox`es intersect
with each other. In an ideal case, this system runs on every frame and checks for collision. It is
also smart enough to filter out only the possible collisions before performing the actual
intersection checks.

Despite this, it is safe to assume that the cost of collision detection will increase as the
number of hitboxes increases. But in many games, the developers are not always interested in
detecting collision between every possible pair. For example, consider a simple game where players
can fire a `Bullet` component that has a hitbox. In such a game it is likely that the developers
are not interested in detecting collision between any two bullets, but Flame will still perform
those collision checks.

To avoid this, you can set the `collisionType` for bullet component to `CollisionType.passive`. Doing
so will cause Flame to completely skip any kind of collision check between all the passive hitboxes.

```{note}
This does not mean bullet component in all games must always have a passive hitbox.
It is up to the developers to decide which hitboxes can be made passive based on
the rules of the game. For example, the Rogue Shooter game in Flame's examples uses
passive hitbox for enemies instead of the bullets.
```

## Object Pooling

As mentioned in the "Object creation per frame" section, creating and destroying objects
frequently can impact performance. For components that are spawned and removed repeatedly
(like bullets, particles, or enemies), object pooling is an effective optimization technique.

Object pooling reuses objects instead of constantly creating and destroying them. Flame
provides the `ComponentPool` class to make object pooling easy and efficient.

### ComponentPool

The `ComponentPool` class manages a pool of reusable components. It automatically handles
the component lifecycle: when a pooled component is removed from its parent, it is
returned to the pool for reuse.

**Creating a pool:**

```dart
class MyGame extends FlameGame {
  late final ComponentPool<Bullet> bulletPool;

  @override
  Future<void> onLoad() async {
    bulletPool = ComponentPool<Bullet>(
      factory: () => Bullet(),
      maxSize: 50,      // Maximum number of bullets to keep in the pool
      initialSize: 10,  // Pre-create 10 bullets for immediate use
    );
  }
}
```

**Acquiring components from the pool:**

When you need a component, use `acquire()` to get one from the pool. If the pool is empty,
a new component will be created automatically using the factory function.

```dart
void spawnBullet(Vector2 position, Vector2 velocity) {
  final bullet = bulletPool.acquire();
  bullet.position.setFrom(position);
  bullet.velocity.setFrom(velocity);
  world.add(bullet);
}
```

**Returning components to the pool:**

Components are returned to the pool **automatically** when they are removed from the game
tree. Simply call `removeFromParent()` on the component. There is no manual release step.

```dart
class Bullet extends SpriteComponent with CollisionCallbacks {
  Vector2 velocity = Vector2.zero();

  @override
  void update(double dt) {
    super.update(dt);
    position.add(velocity * dt);

    // Remove bullet if it goes off screen. Automatically returned to pool.
    if (position.x < -100 || position.x > game.size.x + 100) {
      removeFromParent();
    }
  }

  @override
  void onCollisionStart(Set<Vector2> points, PositionComponent other) {
    super.onCollisionStart(points, other);
    // Return to pool on collision. No manual release needed.
    removeFromParent();
  }

  @override
  void onMount() {
    super.onMount();
    // Reset visual/internal state here so the component is clean when reused.
    // Caller-configured state (position, velocity) should NOT be reset here
    // because it is set between acquire() and add().
  }
}
```

### Pool Management

**Checking available components:**

You can check how many components are currently available in the pool:

```dart
print('Available bullets: ${bulletPool.availableCount}');
```

**Clearing the pool:**

If you need to free up memory or reset the pool, you can clear all available components:

```dart
bulletPool.clear();
```

```{note}
Clearing only affects components currently in the pool. Components that are in use
(acquired but not yet released) are not affected.
```

### Best Practices

1. **No special mixin needed**: Any `Component` subclass can be pooled. Just pass a factory
   function to `ComponentPool` and you're ready to go.

2. **Use `onMount` to reset internal state**: Reset visual or internal properties (e.g.
   animation frame, bounce phase) in `onMount()`. Do not reset caller-configured state
   (like position or velocity) there, since those are set between `acquire()` and `add()`.

3. **Just call `removeFromParent()`**: Components are returned to the pool automatically
   when removed. There is no manual release method to call.

4. **Set appropriate pool sizes**: Set `maxSize` based on your game's needs. Too small and
   you'll create new objects frequently; too large and you'll waste memory.

5. **Use `initialSize` for warm-up**: Set `initialSize` to pre-create commonly used
   components, reducing frame drops during gameplay.

6. **Pool behavior is LIFO**: The pool uses a stack (Last In, First Out) internally, meaning
   the most recently returned component will be the next one acquired.

# Util

On this page you can find documentation for some utility classes and methods.

## Device Class

```{warning}
Many methods in this class only work on mobile platforms (Android and iOS).

Using these methods on other platforms will not have any effect and you will
get a warning printed on your console when running in debug mode.
```

This class can be accessed from `Flame.device` and it has some methods that can be used to control
the state of the device, for instance you can change the screen orientation and set whether the
application should be fullscreen or not.

### `Flame.device.fullScreen()`

When called, this disables all `SystemUiOverlay` making the app full screen.
When called in the main method, it makes your app full screen (no top nor bottom bars).

**Note:** It has no effect when called on the web.

### `Flame.device.setLandscape()`

This method sets the orientation of the whole application (effectively, also the game) to landscape
and depending on operating system and device setting, should allow both left and right landscape
orientations. To set the app orientation to landscape on a specific direction, use either
`Flame.device.setLandscapeLeftOnly` or `Flame.device.setLandscapeRightOnly`.

**Note:** It has no effect when called on the web.

### `Flame.device.setPortrait()`

This method sets the orientation of the whole application (effectively, also the game) to portrait
and depending on operating system and device setting, it should allow for both up and down portrait
orientations. To set the app orientation to portrait for a specific direction, use either
`Flame.device.setPortraitUpOnly` or `Flame.device.setPortraitDownOnly`.

**Note:** It has no effect when called on the web.

### `Flame.device.setOrientation()` and `Flame.device.setOrientations()`

If a finer control of the allowed orientations is required (without having to deal with
`SystemChrome` directly), `setOrientation` (accepts a single `DeviceOrientation` as a parameter) and
`setOrientations` (accepts a `List<DeviceOrientation>` for possible orientations) can be used.

**Note:** It has no effect when called on the web.

## Timer

Flame provides a simple utility class to help you handle countdowns and timer state changes like
events.

Countdown example:

```dart
import 'package:flame/components.dart';
import 'package:flame/game.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class MyGame extends Game {
  final TextPaint textPaint = TextPaint(
    style: const TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 20),
  );

  final countdown = Timer(2);

  @override
  void update(double dt) {
    countdown.update(dt);
    if (countdown.finished) {
      // Prefer the timer callback, but this is better in some cases
    }
  }

  @override
  void render(Canvas canvas) {
    textPaint.render(
      canvas,
      "Countdown: ${countdown.current.toString()}",
      Vector2(10, 100),
    );
  }
}

```

Interval example:

```dart
import 'package:flame/components.dart';
import 'package:flame/game.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class MyGame extends Game {
  final TextPaint textPaint = TextPaint(
    style: const TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 20),
  );
  Timer interval;

  int elapsedSecs = 0;

  MyGame() {
    interval = Timer(
      1,
      onTick: () => elapsedSecs += 1,
      repeat: true,
    );
  }

  @override
  void update(double dt) {
    interval.update(dt);
  }

  @override
  void render(Canvas canvas) {
    textPaint.render(canvas, "Elapsed time: $elapsedSecs", Vector2(10, 150));
  }
}

```

`Timer` instances can also be used inside a `FlameGame` game by using the `TimerComponent` class.

`TimerComponent` example:

```dart
import 'package:flame/timer.dart';
import 'package:flame/components.dart';
import 'package:flame/game.dart';

class MyFlameGame extends FlameGame {
  MyFlameGame() {
    add(
      TimerComponent(
        period: 10,
        repeat: true,
        onTick: () => print('10 seconds elapsed'),
      )
    );
  }
}
```

```{note}
A `Timer` or `TimerComponent` can repeat indefinitely by providing the
`repeat: true` argument or it can be repeated a certain number of
times by using the `tickCount` argument together with `repeat: true`.
```

## Time Scale

In many games it is often desirable to create slow-motion or fast-forward effects based on some in
game events. A very common approach to achieve these results is to manipulate the in game time or
tick rate.

To make this manipulation easier, Flame provides a `HasTimeScale` mixin. This mixin can be attached
to any Flame `Component` and exposes a simple get/set API for `timeScale`. The default value of
`timeScale` is `1`, implying in-game time of the component is running at the same speed as real life
time. Setting it to `2` will make the component tick twice as fast and setting it to `0.5` will make
it tick at half the speed as compared to real life time. This mixin also provides `pause` and `resume`
methods, which can be used instead of manually setting the timeScale to 0 and 1 respectively.

Since `FlameGame` is a `Component` too, this mixin can be attached to the `FlameGame` as well. Doing
so will allow controlling time scale for all the component of the game from a single place.

```{note}
HasTimeScale cannot control the movement of BodyComponent from flame_forge2d individually.
It is only useful if the whole Game or Forge2DWorld is to be time scaled.
```

```{flutter-app}
:sources: ../flame/examples
:page: time_scale
:show: widget code infobox
:width: 180
:height: 160
```

```dart
import 'package:flame/components.dart';
import 'package:flame/game.dart';

class MyFlameGame extends FlameGame with HasTimeScale {
  void speedUp(){
    timeScale = 2.0;
  }

  void slowDown(){
    timeScale = 1.0;
  }
}
```

## Extensions

Flame bundles a collection of utility extensions, these extensions are meant to help the developer
with shortcuts and conversion methods, here you can find the summary of those extensions.

They can all be imported from `package:flame/extensions.dart`

### Canvas

- `%`: Modulo/Remainder of x and y separately of two `Vector2`s.

### Matrix4

This class comes from the `vector_math` package. We have created a few extension methods on top
of what is already offered by `vector_math`.

Methods:

- `translate2`: Translate the `Matrix4` by the given `Vector2`.
- `transform2`: Create a new `Vector2` by transforming the given `Vector2` using the `Matrix4`.
- `transformed2`: Transform the input `Vector2` into the output `Vector2`.

Getters:

- `m11`: The first row and first column.
- `m12`: The first row and second column.
- `m13`: The first row and third column.
- `m14`: The first row and fourth column.
- `m21`: The second row and first column.
- `m22`: The second row and second column.
- `m23`: The second row and third column.
- `m24`: The second row and fourth column.
- `m31`: The third row and first column.
- `m32`: The third row and second column.
- `m33`: The third row and third column.
- `m34`: The third row and fourth column.
- `m41`: The fourth row and first column.
- `m42`: The fourth row and second column.
- `m43`: The fourth row and third column.
- `m44`: The fourth row and fourth column.

Factories:

- `Matrix4Extension.scale`: Create a scaled `Matrix4`. Either by passing a `Vector4` or `Vector2`
  as it's first argument, or by passing x y z doubles.

# Widgets

One advantage when developing games with Flutter is the ability to use Flutter's extensive toolset
for building UIs, Flame tries to expand on that by introducing widgets that are made with games in
mind.

Here you can find all the available widgets provided by Flame.

You can also see all the widgets showcased inside a
[Dashbook](https://github.com/bluefireteam/dashbook) sandbox in the
[widgets examples directory](https://github.com/flame-engine/flame/tree/main/examples/lib/stories/widgets).

## NineTileBoxWidget

A Nine Tile Box is a rectangle drawn using a grid sprite.

The grid sprite is a 3x3 grid and with 9 blocks, representing the 4 corners, the 4 sides and the
middle.

The corners are drawn at the same size, the sides are stretched on the side direction and the middle
is expanded both ways.

The `NineTileBoxWidget` implements a `Container` using that standard. This pattern is also
implemented as a component in the `NineTileBoxComponent` so that you can add this feature directly
to your `FlameGame`. To learn more, check the
[NineTileBoxComponent docs](../components/utility_components.md#ninetileboxcomponent).

Here you can find an example of how to use it (without using the `NineTileBoxComponent`):

```dart
import 'package:flame/widgets';

NineTileBoxWidget(
    image: image, // dart:ui image instance
    tileSize: 16, // The width/height of the tile on your grid image
    destTileSize: 50, // The dimensions for the tile on canvas
    child: SomeWidget(), // Any Flutter widget
)
```

## SpriteButton

`SpriteButton` is a simple widget that creates a button based on Flame sprites. This can be very
useful when trying to create non-default looking buttons. For example when it is easier for you to
achieve your wanted look by drawing the button in a graphics editor, instead of making it directly
in Flutter.

How to use it:

```dart
SpriteButton(
    onPressed: () {
      print('Pressed');
    },
    label: const Text('Sprite Button', style: const TextStyle(color: const Color(0xFF5D275D))),
    sprite: _spriteButton,
    pressedSprite: _pressedSprite,
    // Optional, will be shown when onPressed in null.
    disabledSprite: _disabledSprite,
    height: _height,
    width: _width,
)
```

## SpriteWidget

`SpriteWidget` is a widget used to display a [Sprite](../rendering/images.md#sprite) inside a widget
tree.

This is how to use it:

```dart
SpriteWidget(
    sprite: yourSprite,
    anchor: Anchor.center,
)
```

## SpriteAnimationWidget

`SpriteAnimationWidget` is a widget used to display
[SpriteAnimations](../rendering/images.md#animation) inside a widget tree.

This is how to use it:

```dart
SpriteAnimationWidget(
    animation: _animation,
    animationTicker: _animationTicker,
    playing: true,
    anchor: Anchor.center,
)
```

# Decorators

**Decorators** are classes that can encapsulate certain visual effects and then apply those visual
effects to a sequence of canvas drawing operations. Decorators are not [Component]s, but they can
be applied to components either manually or via the [HasDecorator] mixin. Likewise, decorators are
not [Effect]s, although they can be used to implement certain `Effect`s.

There are a certain number of decorators available in Flame, and it is simple to add one's own if
necessary. We are planning to add shader-based decorators once Flutter fully supports them on the
web.

## Flame built-in decorators

### PaintDecorator.blur

```{flutter-app}
:sources: ../flame/examples
:page: decorator_blur
:show: widget code infobox
:width: 180
:height: 160
```

This decorator applies a Gaussian blur to the underlying component. The amount of blur can be
different in the X and Y direction, though this is not very common.

```dart
final decorator = PaintDecorator.blur(3.0);
```

Possible uses:

- soft shadows;
- "out-of-focus" objects in the distance or very close to the camera;
- motion blur effects;
- deemphasize/obscure content when showing a popup dialog;
- blurred vision when the character is drunk.

### PaintDecorator.grayscale

```{flutter-app}
:sources: ../flame/examples
:page: decorator_grayscale
:show: widget code infobox
:width: 180
:height: 160
```

This decorator converts the underlying image into the shades of grey, as if it was a
black-and-white photograph. In addition, you can make the image semi-transparent to the desired
level of `opacity`.

```dart
final decorator = PaintDecorator.grayscale(opacity: 0.5);
```

Possible uses:

- apply to an NPC to turn them into stone, or into a ghost!
- apply to a scene to indicate that it is a memory of the past;
- black-and-white photos.

### PaintDecorator.tint

```{flutter-app}
:sources: ../flame/examples
:page: decorator_tint
:show: widget code infobox
:width: 180
:height: 160
```

This decorator _tints_ the underlying image with the specified color, as if watching it through a
colored glass. It is recommended that the `color` used by this decorator was semi-transparent, so
that you can see the details of the image below.

```dart
final decorator = PaintDecorator.tint(const Color(0xAAFF0000);
```

Possible uses:

- NPCs affected by certain types of magic;
- items/characters in the shadows can be tinted black;
- tint the scene red to show bloodlust, or that the character is low on health;
- tint green to show that the character is poisoned or sick;
- tint the scene deep blue during the night time;

### Rotate3DDecorator

```{flutter-app}
:sources: ../flame/examples
:page: decorator_rotate3d
:show: widget code infobox
:width: 180
:height: 160
```

This decorator applies a 3D rotation to the underlying component. You can specify the angles of the
rotation, as well as the pivot point and the amount of perspective distortion to apply.

The decorator also supplies the `isFlipped` property, which allows you to determine whether the
component is currently being viewed from the front side or from the back. This is useful if you want
to draw a component whose appearance is different in the front and in the back.

```dart
final decorator = Rotate3DDecorator(
  center: component.center,
  angleX: rotationAngle,
  perspective: 0.002,
);
```

Possible uses:

- a card that can be flipped over;
- pages in a book;
- transitions between app routes;
- 3d falling particles such as snowflakes or leaves.

### Shadow3DDecorator

```{flutter-app}
:sources: ../flame/examples
:page: decorator_shadow3d
:show: widget code infobox
:width: 180
:height: 160
```

This decorator renders a shadow underneath the component, as if the component was a 3D object
standing on a plane. This effect works best for games that use isometric camera projection.

The shadow produced by this generator is quite flexible: you can control its angle, length, opacity,
blur, etc. For a full description of what properties this decorator has and their meaning, see the
class documentation.

```dart
final decorator = Shadow3DDecorator(
  base: Vector2(100, 150),
  angle: -1.4,
  xShift: 200,
  yScale: 1.5,
  opacity: 0.5,
  blur: 1.5,
);
```

The primary purpose of this decorator is to add shadows on the ground to your components. The main
limitation is that the shadows are flat and cannot interact with the environment. For example, this
decorator cannot handle shadows that fall onto walls or other vertical structures.

## Using decorators

### HasDecorator mixin

This `Component` mixin adds the `decorator` property, which is initially `null`. If you set this
property to an actual `Decorator` object, then that decorator will apply its visual effect during
the rendering of the component. In order to remove this visual effect, simply set the `decorator`
property back to `null`.

### PositionComponent

`PositionComponent` (and all the derived classes) already has a `decorator` property, so for these
components the `HasDecorator` mixin is not needed.

In fact, the `PositionComponent` uses its decorator in order to properly position the component on
the screen. Thus, any new decorators that you'd want to apply to the `PositionComponent` will need
to be chained (see the [](#multiple-decorators) section below).

It is also possible to replace the root decorator of the `PositionComponent`, if you want to create
an alternative logic for how the component shall be positioned on the screen.

### Multiple decorators

It is possible to apply several decorators simultaneously to the same component: the `Decorator`
class supports chaining. That is, if you have an existing decorator on a component and you want to
add another one, then you can call `component.decorator.addLast(newDecorator)`. This will add
the new decorator at the end of the existing chain. The method `removeLast()` can remove that
decorator later.

Several decorators can be chain that way. For example, if `A` is an initial decorator, then
`A.addLast(B)` can be followed by either `A.addLast(C)` or `B.addLast(C)`, and in both cases the
chain `A -> B -> C` will be created. In practice, it means that the entire chain can be manipulated
from its root, which usually is `component.decorator`.

# Images

To start off you must have an appropriate folder structure and add the files to the `pubspec.yaml`
file, like this:

```yaml
flutter:
  assets:
    - assets/images/player.png
    - assets/images/enemy.png
```

Images can be in any format supported by Flutter, which include: JPEG, WebP, PNG, GIF, animated GIF,
animated WebP, BMP, and WBMP. Other formats would require additional libraries. For example, SVG
images can be loaded via the `flame_svg` library.

## Loading images

Flame bundles an utility class called `Images` that allows you to easily load and cache images from
the assets directory into memory.

Flutter has a handful of types related to images, and converting everything properly from a local
asset to an `Image` that can be drawn on Canvas is a bit convoluted. This class allows you to obtain
an `Image` that can be drawn on the `Canvas` using the `drawImageRect` method.

It automatically caches any image loaded by filename, so you can safely call it many times.

The methods for loading and clearing the cache are: `load`, `loadAll`, `clear` and `clearCache`.
They return `Future`s for loading the images. These futures must be awaited for before the images
can be used in any way. If you do not want to await these futures right away, you can initiate
multiple `load()` operations and then await for all of them at once using `Images.ready()` method.

To synchronously retrieve a previously cached image, the `fromCache` method can be used. If an image
with that key was not previously loaded, it will throw an exception.

To add an already loaded image to the cache, the `add` method can be used and you can set the key
that the image should have in the cache. You can retrieve all the keys in the cache using the `keys`
getter.

You can also use `ImageExtension.fromPixels()` to dynamically create an image during the game.

For `clear` and `clearCache`, do note that `dispose` is called for each removed image from the
cache, so make sure that you don't use the image afterwards.

### Standalone usage

It can manually be used by instantiating it:

```dart
import 'package:flame/cache.dart';
final imagesLoader = Images();
Image image = await imagesLoader.load('yourImage.png');
```

But Flame also offers two ways of using this class without instantiating it yourself.

### Flame.images

There is a singleton, provided by the `Flame` class, that can be used as a global image cache.

Example:

```dart
import 'package:flame/flame.dart';
import 'package:flame/sprite.dart';

// inside an async context
Image image = await Flame.images.load('player.png');

final playerSprite = Sprite(image);
```

### Game.images

The `Game` class offers some utility methods for handling images loading too. It bundles an instance
of the `Images` class, that can be used to load image assets to be used during the game. The game
will automatically free the cache when the game widget is removed from the widget tree.

The `onLoad` method from the `Game` class is a great place for the initial assets to be loaded.

Example:

```dart
class MyGame extends Game {

  Sprite player;

  @override
  Future<void> onLoad() async {
    // Note that you could also use Sprite.load for this.
    final playerImage = await images.load('player.png');
    player = Sprite(playerImage);
  }
}
```

Loaded assets can also be retrieved while the game is running by `images.fromCache`, for example:

```dart
class MyGame extends Game {

  // attributes omitted

  @override
  Future<void> onLoad() async {
    // other loads omitted
    await images.load('bullet.png');
  }

  void shoot() {
    // This is just an example, in your game you probably don't want to
    // instantiate new [Sprite] objects every time you shoot.
    final bulletSprite = Sprite(images.fromCache('bullet.png'));
    _bullets.add(bulletSprite);
  }
}
```

## Loading images over the network

The Flame core package doesn't offer a built in method to loading images from the network.

The reason for that is that Flutter/Dart does not have a built in http client, which requires
a package to be used and since there are a couple of packages available out there, we refrain
from forcing the user to use a specific package.

With that said, it is quite simple to load images from the network once a http client package
is chosen by the user. The following snippet shows how an `Image` can be fetched from the web
using the [http](https://pub.dev/packages/http) package.

```dart
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;
import 'package:flutter/painting.dart';

final response = await http.get('https://url.com/image.png');
final image = await decodeImageFromList(response.bytes);
```

```{note}
Check [`flame_network_assets`](https://pub.dev/packages/flame_network_assets)
for a ready to use network assets solution that provides a built in cache.
```

## Sprite

Flame offers a `Sprite` class that represents an image, or a region of an image.

You can create a `Sprite` by providing it an `Image` and coordinates that defines the piece of the
image that that sprite represents.

For example, this will create a sprite representing the whole image of the file passed:

```dart
final image = await images.load('player.png');
Sprite player = Sprite(image);
```

You can also specify the coordinates in the original image where the sprite is located. This allows
you to use sprite sheets and reduce the number of images in memory, for example:

```dart
final image = await images.load('player.png');
final playerFrame = Sprite(
  image,
  srcPosition: Vector2(32.0, 0),
  srcSize: Vector2(16.0, 16.0),
);
```

The default values are `(0.0, 0.0)` for `srcPosition` and `null` for `srcSize` (meaning it will use
the full width/height of the source image).

The `Sprite` class has a render method, that allows you to render the sprite onto a `Canvas`:

```dart
final image = await images.load('block.png');
Sprite block = Sprite(image);

// in your render method
block.render(canvas, 16.0, 16.0); //canvas, width, height
```

You must pass the size to the render method, and the image will be resized accordingly.

All render methods from the `Sprite` class can receive a `Paint` instance as the optional named
parameter `overridePaint` that parameter will override the current `Sprite` paint instance for that
render call.

`Sprite`s can also be used as widgets, to do so just use `SpriteWidget` class.
Here is a complete
[example using sprite as widgets](https://github.com/flame-engine/flame/blob/main/examples/lib/stories/widgets/sprite_widget_example.dart).

### Sprite Bleeding

In some cases when rendering sprites next to each other, when the edges of the sprites are touching,
you may see a rendering artifact called "ghost lines" between them.

This happens especially when the sprites are positioned in coordinates that are not whole numbers,
or when scaling is applied to the canvas.

Those lines appear because floating-point numbers aren't 100% accurate in computer science. Due
to rounding errors, even though the sprites are supposed to be touching, they are not rendered that
way.

One way to avoid this is to use a technique called "bleeding", which consists of adding a very small
margin to the edges of the sprites, so that when they are rendered, they will overlap a bit and thus
avoid rendering the ghost lines.

Flame provides a way to do this by using the `bleed` parameter in the `Sprite` render method. This
is a double value that represents the amount of bleeding to be applied to the edges of the sprite.

For example, if you do:

```dart
final image = await images.load('player.png');
final playerFrame = Sprite(
  image,
  srcPosition: Vector2(32.0, 0),
  srcSize: Vector2(16.0, 16.0),
);
playerFrame.render(canvas, 16.0, 16.0, bleed: 1.0);
```

The sprite will be rendered with a bleed amount of 1.0, meaning that it will have
a value of 1 pixels added to each edge of the sprite.

For users of the `SpriteComponent`, using the bleeding feature is also quite simple, it is just
a matter of passing a value to the `bleed` attribute in the component constructor:

```dart
final sprite = Sprite(...);

final spriteComponent = SpriteComponent(
  sprite: sprite,
  size: Vector2.all(16.0),
  bleed: 1.0, // bleed value
);
```

Note that the amount of the bleed value depends on the size of the sprite, so a bleed value of 1.0
might not make much difference for a sprite of 100x100.

### Sprite Rasterization

Rasterizing a sprite is the process of extracting the selected area of the image from that sprite,
storing it in memory, and returning a new Sprite that contains that rasterized image.

That can be used for a variety of reasons, one of the most useful ones is to avoid texture leaking
when using a sprite sheet.

Texture leaking can happen for the same reason as in the issue explained above (floating point
rounding errors), and it causes parts outside of a sprite selection to also be rendered.

Extracting the sprite selection and rasterizing it before rendering is a way to avoid this issue,
since it then renders an image that only contains the selected area.

Example of using a `RasterSpriteComponent`:

```dart
final sprite = await Sprite.load('flame.png');
final rasterSpriteComponent = RasterSpriteComponent(
  sprite: sprite,
  size: Vector2.all(16.0),
);
```

When using the `RasterSpriteComponent`, it will automatically rasterize the sprite when it is
loaded.

If you need to rasterize a sprite manually, you can use the `Sprite.rasterize` method:

```dart
final image = await images.load('player.png');
final playerFrame = Sprite(
  image,
  srcPosition: Vector2(32.0, 0),
  srcSize: Vector2(16.0, 16.0),
);

final rasterizedSprite = await playerFrame.rasterize();
```

By default, the `rasterize` method will use `Flame.images` to cache the rasterized image,
auto generating a key based on the sprite's source position and size. If you want to use a custom
key for the rasterized image, or use a different cache object, you can pass it as an optional
parameter:

```dart
final rasterizedSprite = await playerFrame.rasterize(
  cacheKey: 'custom_key_for_rasterized_image',
  images: Images(),
);
```

## SpriteBatch

If you have a sprite sheet (also called an image atlas, which is an image with smaller images
inside), and would like to render it effectively - `SpriteBatch` handles that job for you.

Give it the filename of the image, and then add rectangles which describes various part of the
image, in addition to transforms (position, scale and rotation) and optional colors.

You render it with a `Canvas` and an optional `Paint`, `BlendMode` and `CullRect`.

A `SpriteBatchComponent` is also available for your convenience.

See how to use it in the
[SpriteBatch examples](https://github.com/flame-engine/flame/blob/main/examples/lib/stories/sprites/sprite_batch_example.dart)

## ImageComposition

In some cases you may want to merge multiple images into a single image; this is called
[Compositing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compositing). This can be useful for example when
working with the [SpriteBatch](#spritebatch) API to optimize your drawing calls.

For such use cases Flame comes with the `ImageComposition` class. This allows you to add multiple
images, each at their own position, onto a new image:

```dart
final composition = ImageComposition()
  ..add(image1, Vector2(0, 0))
  ..add(image2, Vector2(64, 0));
  ..add(image3,
    Vector2(128, 0),
    source: Rect.fromLTWH(32, 32, 64, 64),
  );

Image image = await composition.compose();
Image imageSync = composition.composeSync();
```

As you can see, two versions of composing image are available. Use `ImageComposition.compose()` for
the async approach. Or use the new `ImageComposition.composeSync()` function to rasterize the
image into GPU context using the benefits of the `Picture.toImageSync` function.

**Note:** Composing images is expensive, we do not recommend you run this every tick as it affect
the performance badly. Instead we recommend to have your compositions pre-rendered so you can just
reuse the output image.

## Animation

The Animation class helps you create a cyclic animation of sprites.

You can create it by passing a list of equally sized sprites and the stepTime (that is, how many
seconds it takes to move to the next frame):

```dart
final a = SpriteAnimationTicker(SpriteAnimation.spriteList(sprites, stepTime: 0.02));
```

After the animation is created, you need to call its `update` method and render the current frame's
sprite on your game instance.

Example:

```dart
class MyGame extends Game {
  SpriteAnimationTicker a;

  MyGame() {
    a = SpriteAnimationTicker(SpriteAnimation(...));
  }

  void update(double dt) {
    a.update(dt);
  }

  void render(Canvas c) {
    a.getSprite().render(c);
  }
}
```

A better alternative to generate a list of sprites is to use the `fromFrameData` constructor:

```dart
const amountOfFrames = 8;
final a = SpriteAnimation.fromFrameData(
    imageInstance,
    SpriteAnimationFrame.sequenced(
      amount: amountOfFrames,
      textureSize: Vector2(16.0, 16.0),
      stepTime: 0.1,
    ),
);
```

This constructor makes creating an `Animation` very easy when using sprite sheets.

In the constructor you pass an image instance and the frame data, which contains some parameters
that can be used to describe the animation. Check the documentation on the constructors available on
the `SpriteAnimationFrameData` class to see all the parameters.

If you use Aseprite for your animations, Flame does provide some support for Aseprite animation's
JSON data. To use this feature you will need to export the Sprite Sheet's JSON data, and use
something like the following snippet:

```dart
final image = await images.load('chopper.png');
final jsonData = await assets.readJson('chopper.json');
final animation = SpriteAnimation.fromAsepriteData(image, jsonData);
```

**Note:** trimmed sprite sheets are not supported by flame, so if you export your sprite sheet this
way, it will have the trimmed size, not the sprite original size.

Animations, after created, have an update and render method; the latter renders the current frame,
and the former ticks the internal clock to update the frames.

Animations are normally used inside `SpriteAnimationComponent`s, but custom components with several
Animations can be created as well.

To learn more, check out the full example code of
[using animations as widgets](https://github.com/flame-engine/flame/blob/main/examples/lib/stories/widgets/sprite_animation_widget_example.dart).

## SpriteSheet

Sprite sheets are big images with several frames of the same sprite on it and is a very good way to
organize and store your animations. Flame provides a very simple utility class to deal with
SpriteSheets, using which you can load your sprite sheet image and extract animations from it as
well. Following is a simple example of how to use it:

```dart
import 'package:flame/sprite.dart';

final spriteSheet = SpriteSheet(
  image: imageInstance,
  srcSize: Vector2.all(16.0),
);

final animation = spriteSheet.createAnimation(0, stepTime: 0.1);
```

Now you can use the animation directly or use it in an animation component.

You can also create a custom animation by retrieving individual `SpriteAnimationFrameData` using
either `SpriteSheet.createFrameData` or `SpriteSheet.createFrameDataFromId`:

```dart
final animation = SpriteAnimation.fromFrameData(
  imageInstance,
  SpriteAnimationData([
    spriteSheet.createFrameDataFromId(1, stepTime: 0.1), // by id
    spriteSheet.createFrameData(2, 3, stepTime: 0.3), // row, column
    spriteSheet.createFrameDataFromId(4, stepTime: 0.1), // by id
  ]),
);
```

If you don't need any kind of animation and instead only want an instance of a `Sprite` on the
`SpriteSheet` you can use the `getSprite` or `getSpriteById` methods:

```dart
spriteSheet.getSpriteById(2); // by id
spriteSheet.getSprite(0, 0); // row, column
```

See a full example of the [`SpriteSheet` class](https://github.com/flame-engine/flame/blob/main/examples/lib/stories/sprites/sprite_sheet_example.dart)
for more details on how to work with it.

# Layers and Snapshots

Layers and snapshots share some common features, including the ability to pre-render and cache
objects for improved performance. However, they also have unique features which make them better
suited for different use-cases.

`Snapshot` is a mixin that can be added to any `PositionComponent`. Use this for:

- Mixing in to existing game objects (that are `PositionComponents`).
- Caching game objects, such as sprites, that are complex to render.
- Drawing the same object many times without rendering it each time.
- Capturing an image snapshot to save as a screenshot (for example).

`Layer` is a class. Use or extend this class for:

- Structuring your game with logical layers (e.g. UI, foreground, main, background).
- Grouping objects to form a complex scene, and then caching it (e.g. a background layer).
- Processor support. Layers allow user-defined processors to run pre- and post- render.

## Layers

Layers allow you to group rendering by context, as well as allow you to pre-render things. This
enables, for example, rendering parts of your game that don't change much in memory, like a
background. By doing this, you'll free processing power for more dynamic content that needs to be
rendered every game tick.

There are two types of layers on Flame:

- `DynamicLayer`: For things that are moving or changing.
- `PreRenderedLayer`: For things that are static.

### DynamicLayer

Dynamic layers are layers that are rendered every time that they are drawn on the canvas. As the
name suggests, it is meant for dynamic content and is most useful for grouping rendering of objects
that have the same context.

Usage example:

```dart
class GameLayer extends DynamicLayer {
  final MyGame game;

  GameLayer(this.game);

  @override
  void drawLayer() {
    game.playerSprite.render(
      canvas,
      position: game.playerPosition,
    );
    game.enemySprite.render(
      canvas,
      position: game.enemyPosition,
    );
  }
}

class MyGame extends Game {
  // Other methods omitted...

  @override
  void render(Canvas canvas) {
    gameLayer.render(canvas); // x and y can be provided as optional position arguments
  }
}
```

### PreRenderedLayer

Pre-rendered layers are rendered only once, cached in memory and then just
replicated on the game canvas afterwards. They are useful for caching content that doesn't change
during the game, like a background for example.

Usage example:

```dart
class BackgroundLayer extends PreRenderedLayer {
  final Sprite sprite;

  BackgroundLayer(this.sprite);

  @override
  void drawLayer() {
    sprite.render(
      canvas,
      position: Vector2(50, 200),
    );
  }
}

class MyGame extends Game {
  // Other methods omitted...

  @override
  void render(Canvas canvas) {
    // x and y can be provided as optional position arguments.
    backgroundLayer.render(canvas);
  }
}
```

### Layer Processors

Flame also provides a way to add processors on your layer, which are ways to add effects on the
entire layer. At the moment, out of the box, only the `ShadowProcessor` is available, this processor
renders a back drop shadow on your layer.

To add processors to your layer, just add them to the layer `preProcessors` or `postProcessors`
list, like so:

```dart
// Works the same for both DynamicLayer and PreRenderedLayer
class BackgroundLayer extends PreRenderedLayer {
  final Sprite sprite;

  BackgroundLayer(this.sprite) {
    preProcessors.add(ShadowProcessor());
  }

  @override
  void drawLayer() { /* omitted */ }

  // ...
```

Custom processors can be created by extending the `LayerProcessor` class.

See [a working example of layers](https://github.com/flame-engine/flame/blob/main/examples/lib/stories/rendering/layers_example.dart).

## Snapshots

Snapshots are an alternative to layers. The `Snapshot` mixin can be applied to any `PositionComponent`.

```dart
class SnapshotComponent extends PositionComponent with Snapshot {}

class MyGame extends FlameGame {
  late final SnapshotComponent root;

  @override
  Future<void> onLoad() async {
    // Add a snapshot component.
    root = SnapshotComponent();
    add(root);
  }
}
```

### Render as a snapshot

Setting `renderSnapshot` to `true` (the default) on a snapshot-enabled component behaves similarly
to a `PreRenderedLayer`. The component is rendered only once, cached in memory and then just
replicated on the game canvas afterwards. This is useful for caching content that doesn't change
during the game, like a background.

```dart
class SnapshotComponent extends PositionComponent with Snapshot {}

class MyGame extends FlameGame {
  late final SnapshotComponent root;
  late final SpriteComponent background1;
  late final SpriteComponent background2;

  @override
  Future<void> onLoad() async {
    // Add a snapshot component.
    root = SnapshotComponent();
    add(root);

    // Add some children.
    final background1Sprite = Sprite(await images.load('background1.png'));
    background1 = SpriteComponent(sprite: background1Sprite);
    root.add(background1);

    final background2Sprite = Sprite(await images.load('background2.png'));
    background2 = SpriteComponent(sprite: background2Sprite);
    root.add(background2);

    // root will now render once (itself and all its children) and then cache
    // the result. On subsequent render calls, root itself, nor any of its
    // children, will be rendered. The snapshot will be used instead for
    // improved performance.
  }
}
```

#### Regenerating a snapshot

A snapshot-enabled component will generate a snapshot of its entire tree, including its children.
If any of the children change (for example, their position changes, or they are animated), call
`takeSnapshot` to update the cached snapshot. If they are changing very frequently, it's best not
to use a `Snapshot` because there will be no performance benefit.

A component rendering a snapshot can still be transformed without incurring any performance cost.
Once a snapshot has been taken, the component may still be scaled, moved and rotated. However, if
the content of the component changes (what it is rendering) then the snapshot must be regenerated
by calling `takeSnapshot`.

### Taking a snapshot

A snapshot-enabled component can be used to generate a snapshot at any time, even if
`renderSnapshot` is set to false. This is useful for taking screen-grabs or any other purpose when
it may be useful to have a static snapshot of all or part of your game.

A snapshot is always generated with no transform applied - i.e. as if the snapshot-enabled
component is at position (0,0) and has no scale or rotation applied.

A snapshot is saved as a `Picture`, but it can be converted to an `Image` using `snapshotToImage`.

```dart
class SnapshotComponent extends PositionComponent with Snapshot {}

class MyGame extends FlameGame {
  late final SnapshotComponent root;

  @override
  Future<void> onLoad() async {
    // Add a snapshot component, but don't use its render mode.
    root = SnapshotComponent()..renderSnapshot = false;
    add(root);

    // Other code omitted.
  }

  // Call something like this to take an image snapshot at any time.
  void takeSnapshot() {
    root.takeSnapshot();
    final image = root.snapshotToImage(200, 200);
  }
}
```

### Snapshots that are cropped or off-center

Sometimes your snapshot `Image` may appear cropped, or not in the position you expected.

This is because the contents of a `Picture` can be positioned anywhere with respect to the origin,
but when it is converted to an `Image`, the image always starts from `0,0`. This means that
anything with a -ve position will be cropped.

The best way to deal with this is to ensure that your `Snapshot` component is always at position
`0,0` with respect to your game and you never move it. This means that the image will usually
contain what you expect it to.

However, this is not always possible. To move (or rotate, or scale etc) the snapshot before
converting it to an image, pass a transformation matrix to `snapshotToImage` like so:

```dart
// Call something like this to take an image snapshot at any time.
void takeSnapshot() {
  // Prepare a matrix to move the snapshot by 200,50.
  final matrix = Matrix4.identity()..translate(200.0,50.0);

  root.takeSnapshot();
  final image = root.snapshotToImage(200, 200, transform: matrix);
}
```

# Palette

Throughout your game you are going to need to use colors in lots of places. There are two classes on
`dart:ui` that can be used, `Color` and `Paint`.

The `Color` class represents a ARGB color in a hexadecimal integer
format. So to create a `Color` instance, you just need to pass the color as an integer in the ARGB
format.

<!--- cSpell:ignore AARRGGBB -->

You can use Dart's hexadecimal notation to make it really easy; for instance: `0xFF00FF00` is fully
opaque green (the "mask" would be `0xAARRGGBB`).

**Note**: The first two hexadecimal digits are for
the alpha channel (transparency), unlike on regular (non-A) RGB. The max(FF = 255) for the two first
digits means fully opaque, and the min (00 = 0) means fully transparent.

In the Material Flutter package there is a `Colors` class that provides common colors as constants:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart' show Colors;

const black = Colors.black;
```

Some more complex methods might also take a `Paint` object, which is a more complete structure that
allows you to configure aspects related to stroke, colors, filters and blends.
However, normally when using even the more complex APIs, you just want an instance of a `Paint`
object representing just a single simple plain solid color.

**Note:** we don't recommend that you create a new `Paint` object every time you need a specific
`Paint`, since it could potentially lead to a lot of unnecessary objects being created. A better way
is to either define the `Paint` object somewhere and re-use it (however, do note that the `Paint`
class is mutable, unlike `Color`), or to use the `Palette` class to define all the colors that you
want to use in your game.

You can create such an object like this:

```dart
Paint green = Paint()..color = const Color(0xFF00FF00);
```

To help you with this and also keep your game's color palette consistent, Flame adds the `Palette`
class. You can use it to easily access both `Color`s and `Paint`s where needed and also define
the colors your game use as constants, so that you don't get those mixed up.

The `BasicPalette` class is an example of what a palette can look like, and adds black and white as
colors. So you can access black or white directly from the `BasicPalette`; for example,
using `color`:

```dart
TextConfig regular = TextConfig(color: BasicPalette.white.color);
```

Or using `paint`:

```dart
canvas.drawRect(rect, BasicPalette.black.paint);
```

However, the idea is that you can create your own palette, following the `BasicPalette` example, and
add the color palette/scheme of your game. Then you will be able to statically access any color in
your components and classes. Below is an example of a `Palette` implementation, from the [example
game BGUG](https://github.com/bluefireteam/bgug/blob/master/lib/palette.dart):

```dart
import 'dart:ui';

import 'package:flame/palette.dart';

class Palette {
  static PaletteEntry white = BasicPalette.white;

  static PaletteEntry toastBackground = PaletteEntry(Color(0xFFAC3232));
  static PaletteEntry toastText = PaletteEntry(Color(0xFFDA9A00));

  static PaletteEntry grey = PaletteEntry(Color(0xFF404040));
  static PaletteEntry green = PaletteEntry(Color(0xFF54a286));
}
```

A `PaletteEntry` is a `const` class that holds information of a color and it has the following
members:

- `color`: returns the `Color` specified
- `paint`: creates a new `Paint` with the color specified. `Paint` is a non-`const` class, so this
  method actually creates a brand new instance every time it's called. It's safe to cascade
  mutations to this.

# Particles

Flame offers a basic, yet robust and extendable particle system. The core concept of this system is
the `Particle` class, which is very similar in its behavior to the `ParticleSystemComponent`.

The most basic usage of a `Particle` with `FlameGame` would look as in the following:

```dart
import 'package:flame/components.dart';

// ...

game.add(
  // Wrapping a Particle with ParticleSystemComponent
  // which maps Component lifecycle hooks to Particle ones
  // and embeds a trigger for removing the component.
  ParticleSystemComponent(
    particle: CircleParticle(),
  ),
);
```

When using `Particle` with a custom `Game` implementation, please ensure that both the `update` and
`render` methods are called during each game loop tick.

Main approaches to implement desired particle effects:

- Composition of existing behaviors.
- Use behavior chaining (just a syntactic sugar of the first one).
- Using `ComputedParticle`.

Composition works in a similar fashion to those of Flutter widgets by defining the effect from top
to bottom. Chaining allows to express the same composition trees more fluently by defining behaviors
from bottom to top. Computed particles in their turn fully delegate implementation of the behavior
to your code. Any of the approaches could be used in conjunction with existing behaviors where
needed.

```dart
Random rnd = Random();

Vector2 randomVector2() => (Vector2.random(rnd) - Vector2.random(rnd)) * 200;

// Composition.
//
// Defining a particle effect as a set of nested behaviors from top to bottom,
// one within another:
//
// ParticleSystemComponent
//   > ComposedParticle
//     > AcceleratedParticle
//       > CircleParticle
game.add(
  ParticleSystemComponent(
    particle: Particle.generate(
      count: 10,
      generator: (i) => AcceleratedParticle(
        acceleration: randomVector2(),
        child: CircleParticle(
          paint: Paint()..color = Colors.red,
        ),
      ),
    ),
  ),
);

// Chaining.
//
// Expresses the same behavior as above, but with a more fluent API.
// Only Particles with SingleChildParticle mixin can be used as chainable behaviors.
game.add(
  ParticleSystemComponent(
    particle: Particle.generate(
      count: 10,
      generator: (i) => pt.CircleParticle(paint: Paint()..color = Colors.red)
    )
  )
);

// Computed Particle.
//
// All the behaviors are defined explicitly. Offers greater flexibility
// compared to built-in behaviors.
game.add(
  ParticleSystemComponent(
      particle: Particle.generate(
        count: 10,
        generator: (i) {
          Vector2 position = Vector2.zero();
          Vector2 speed = Vector2.zero();
          final acceleration = randomVector2();
          final paint = Paint()..color = Colors.red;

          return ComputedParticle(
            renderer: (canvas, _) {
              speed += acceleration;
              position += speed;
              canvas.drawCircle(Offset(position.x, position.y), 1, paint);
            }
        );
      }
    )
  )
);
```

See more [examples of how to use built-in particles in various
combinations](https://github.com/flame-engine/flame/blob/main/examples/lib/stories/rendering/particles_example.dart).

## Lifecycle

A behavior common to all `Particle`s is that all of them accept a `lifespan` argument. This value is
used to make the `ParticleSystemComponent` remove itself once its internal `Particle` has reached
the end of its life. Time within the `Particle` itself is tracked using the Flame `Timer` class. It
can be configured with a `double`, represented in seconds (with microsecond precision) by passing
it into the corresponding `Particle` constructor.

```dart
Particle(lifespan: .2); // will live for 200ms.
Particle(lifespan: 4); // will live for 4s.
```

It is also possible to reset a `Particle`'s lifespan by using the `setLifespan` method, which also
accepts a `double` of seconds.

```dart
final particle = Particle(lifespan: 2);

// ... after some time.
particle.setLifespan(2) // will live for another 2s.
```

During its lifetime, a `Particle` tracks the time it was alive and exposes it through the `progress`
getter, which returns a value between `0.0` and `1.0`. This value can be used in a similar fashion
as the `value` property of the `AnimationController` class in Flutter.

```dart
final particle = Particle(lifespan: 2.0);

game.add(ParticleSystemComponent(particle: particle));

// Will print values from 0 to 1 with step of .1: 0, 0.1, 0.2 ... 0.9, 1.0.
Timer.periodic(duration * .1, () => print(particle.progress));
```

The `lifespan` is passed down to all the descendants of a given `Particle`, if it supports any of
the nesting behaviors.

## Built-in particles

Flame ships with a few built-in `Particle` behaviors:

- The `TranslatedParticle` translates its `child` by given `Vector2`
- The `MovingParticle` moves its `child` between two predefined `Vector2`, supports `Curve`
- The `AcceleratedParticle` allows basic physics based effects, like gravitation or speed dampening
- The `CircleParticle` renders circles of all shapes and sizes
- The `SpriteParticle` renders Flame `Sprite` within a `Particle` effect
- The `ImageParticle` renders _dart:ui_ `Image` within a `Particle` effect
- The `ComponentParticle` renders Flame `Component` within a `Particle` effect
- The `FlareParticle` renders Flare animation within a `Particle` effect

See more [examples of how to use built-in Particle behaviors
together](https://github.com/flame-engine/flame/blob/main/examples/lib/stories/rendering/particles_example.dart).
All the implementations are available in the [particles folder on the
Flame repository.](https://github.com/flame-engine/flame/tree/main/packages/flame/lib/src/particles)

## TranslatedParticle

Simply translates the underlying `Particle` to a specified `Vector2` within the rendering `Canvas`.
Does not change or alter its position, consider using `MovingParticle` or `AcceleratedParticle`
where change of position is required. Same effect could be achieved by translating the `Canvas`
layer.

```dart
game.add(
  ParticleSystemComponent(
    particle: TranslatedParticle(
      // Will translate the child Particle effect to the center of game canvas.
      offset: game.size / 2,
      child: Particle(),
    ),
  ),
);
```

## MovingParticle

Moves the child `Particle` between the `from` and `to` `Vector2`s during its lifespan. Supports
`Curve` via `CurvedParticle`.

```dart
game.add(
  ParticleSystemComponent(
    particle: MovingParticle(
      // Will move from corner to corner of the game canvas.
      from: Vector2.zero(),
      to: game.size,
      child: CircleParticle(
        radius: 2.0,
        paint: Paint()..color = Colors.red,
      ),
    ),
  ),
);
```

## AcceleratedParticle

A basic physics particle which allows you to specify its initial `position`, `speed` and
`acceleration` and lets the `update` cycle do the rest. All three are specified as `Vector2`s, which
you can think of as vectors. It works especially well for physics-based "bursts", but it is not
limited to that. Unit of the `Vector2` value is _logical px/s_. So a speed of `Vector2(0, 100)` will
move a child `Particle` by 100 logical pixels of the device every second of game time.

```dart
final rnd = Random();
Vector2 randomVector2() => (Vector2.random(rnd) - Vector2.random(rnd)) * 100;

game.add(
  ParticleSystemComponent(
    particle: AcceleratedParticle(
      // Will fire off in the center of game canvas
      position: game.canvasSize/2,
      // With random initial speed of Vector2(-100..100, 0..-100)
      speed: Vector2(rnd.nextDouble() * 200 - 100, -rnd.nextDouble() * 100),
      // Accelerating downwards, simulating "gravity"
      // speed: Vector2(0, 100),
      child: CircleParticle(
        radius: 2.0,
        paint: Paint()..color = Colors.red,
      ),
    ),
  ),
);
```

## CircleParticle

A `Particle` which renders a circle with given `Paint` at the zero offset of passed `Canvas`. Use in
conjunction with `TranslatedParticle`, `MovingParticle` or `AcceleratedParticle` in order to achieve
desired positioning.

```dart
game.add(
  ParticleSystemComponent(
    particle: CircleParticle(
      radius: game.size.x / 2,
      paint: Paint()..color = Colors.red.withValues(alpha: .5),
    ),
  ),
);
```

## SpriteParticle

Allows you to embed a `Sprite` into your particle effects.

```dart
game.add(
  ParticleSystemComponent(
    particle: SpriteParticle(
      sprite: Sprite('sprite.png'),
      size: Vector2(64, 64),
    ),
  ),
);
```

## ImageParticle

Renders given `dart:ui` image within the particle tree.

```dart
// During game initialization
await Flame.images.loadAll(const [
  'image.png',
]);

// ...

// Somewhere during the game loop
final image = await Flame.images.load('image.png');

game.add(
  ParticleSystemComponent(
    particle: ImageParticle(
      size: Vector2.all(24),
      image: image,
    );
  ),
);
```

## ScalingParticle

Scales the child `Particle` between `1` and `to` during its lifespan.

```dart
game.add(
  ParticleSystemComponent(
    particle: ScalingParticle(
      lifespan: 2,
      to: 0,
      curve: Curves.easeIn,
      child: CircleParticle(
        radius: 2.0,
        paint: Paint()..color = Colors.red,
      )
    );
  ),
);
```

## SpriteAnimationParticle

A `Particle` which embeds a `SpriteAnimation`.
By default, aligns the `SpriteAnimation`'s `stepTime` so that
it's fully played during the `Particle` lifespan. It's possible to override this behavior with the
`alignAnimationTime` argument.

```dart
final spriteSheet = SpriteSheet(
  image: yourSpriteSheetImage,
  srcSize: Vector2.all(16.0),
);

game.add(
  ParticleSystemComponent(
    particle: SpriteAnimationParticle(
      animation: spriteSheet.createAnimation(0, stepTime: 0.1),
    );
  ),
);
```

## ComponentParticle

This `Particle` allows you to embed a `Component` within the particle effects. The `Component` could
have its own `update` lifecycle and could be reused across different effect trees. If the only thing
you need is to add some dynamics to an instance of a certain `Component`, please consider adding it
to the `game` directly, without the `Particle` in the middle.

```dart
final longLivingRect = RectComponent();

game.add(
  ParticleSystemComponent(
    particle: ComponentParticle(
      component: longLivingRect
    );
  ),
);

class RectComponent extends Component {
  void render(Canvas c) {
    c.drawRect(
      Rect.fromCenter(center: Offset.zero, width: 100, height: 100),
      Paint()..color = Colors.red
    );
  }

  void update(double dt) {
    /// Will be called by parent [Particle]
  }
}
```

## ComputedParticle

A `Particle` which could help you when:

- Default behavior is not enough
- Complex effects optimization
- Custom easings

When created, it delegates all the rendering to a supplied `ParticleRenderDelegate` which is called
on each frame to perform necessary computations and render something to the `Canvas`.

```dart
game.add(
  ParticleSystemComponent(
    // Renders a circle which gradually changes its color and size during the
    // particle lifespan.
    particle: ComputedParticle(
      renderer: (canvas, particle) => canvas.drawCircle(
        Offset.zero,
        particle.progress * 10,
        Paint()
          ..color = Color.lerp(
            Colors.red,
            Colors.blue,
            particle.progress,
          ),
      ),
    ),
  ),
)
```

## Nesting behavior

Flame's implementation of particles follows the same pattern of extreme composition as Flutter
widgets. That is achieved by encapsulating small pieces of behavior in every particle and then
nesting these behaviors together to achieve the desired visual effect.

Two entities that allow `Particle`s to nest each other are: `SingleChildParticle` mixin and
`ComposedParticle` class.

A `SingleChildParticle` may help you with creating `Particles` with a custom behavior. For example,
randomly positioning its child during each frame:

The `SingleChildParticle` may help you with creating `Particles` with a custom behavior.

For example, randomly positioning it's child during each frame:

```dart
var rnd = Random();

class GlitchParticle extends Particle with SingleChildParticle {
  Particle child;

  GlitchParticle({
    required this.child,
    super.lifespan,
  });

  @override
  render(Canvas canvas)  {
    canvas.save();
    canvas.translate(rnd.nextDouble() * 100, rnd.nextDouble() * 100);

    // Will also render the child
    super.render();

    canvas.restore();
  }
}
```

The `ComposedParticle` could be used either as a standalone or within an existing `Particle` tree.

# Post Processing and Shaders

Post processing is a technique used in game development to apply visual effects to a component tree
after it has been rendered. Once a frame is rendered, either directly or rasterized into an
image, post processing can modify or enhance the visuals.

Post processing leverages fragment shaders to create dynamic visual effects such as blur, bloom,
color grading, distortion, and lighting adjustments.

In Flame, the post processing system is modular and flexible, allowing developers to:

- Define custom post processes by sub-classing the abstract class `PostProcess`.
- Apply a single post process effect or chain multiple effects using groups.
- Manage effects globally with the `CameraComponent` or locally with `PostProcessComponent`.

## Key Components of the Post Processing System

- **`PostProcess`**: Abstract base class for defining custom post-processing effects. Implement
  your effect logic in its `postProcess` method.

- **`PostProcessComponent`**: Applies a post process specifically to its children, enabling
  localized effects.

- **`CameraComponent`**: Applies post processes globally to the entire scene or world.

- **`PostProcessGroup`**: Applies multiple post processes in parallel, useful when effects can be
  applied independently.

- **`PostProcessSequentialGroup`**: Applies post processes sequentially, where each process uses
  the output of the previous one.

## PostProcessComponent

```{dartdoc}
:package: flame
:symbol: PostProcessComponent
:file: src/post_process/post_process_component.dart
```

## Creating a Custom Post Process

To implement a custom post process:

1. Subclass `PostProcess`.
2. Override the `postProcess` method, implementing your rendering logic with `renderSubtree` or
   `rasterizeSubtree`.
3. Optionally, implement `onLoad` and `update` methods for managing resources and updating effects
   each frame.

This system makes it easy to add creative and useful visual effects to your Flame game.

## Example: pixelation

Here’s an example of creating a pixelation effect using a fragment shader:

```dart
class PostProcessGame extends FlameGame {
  @override
  Future<void> onLoad() async {
    await super.onLoad();

    world.add(
      PostProcessComponent(
        postProcess: PixelationPostProcess(),
        anchor: Anchor.center,
        children: [
          EmberPlayer(size: Vector2(100, 100)),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

class PixelationPostProcess extends PostProcess {
  @override
  Future<void> onLoad() async {
    await super.onLoad();

    _fragmentProgram = await FragmentProgram.fromAsset(
      'packages/flutter_shaders/shaders/pixelation.frag',
    );
  }

  late final FragmentProgram _fragmentProgram;
  late final FragmentShader _fragmentShader = _fragmentProgram.fragmentShader();

  double _time = 0;

  @override
  void update(double dt) {
    super.update(dt);
    _time += dt;
  }

  late final myPaint = Paint()..shader = _fragmentShader;

  @override
  void postProcess(Vector2 size, Canvas canvas) {
    final preRenderedSubtree = rasterizeSubtree();

    _fragmentShader.setFloatUniforms((value) {
      value
        ..setVector(size / (20 * sin(_time)))
        ..setVector(size);
    });

    _fragmentShader.setImageSampler(0, preRenderedSubtree);

    canvas
      ..save()
      ..drawRect(Offset.zero & size.toSize(), myPaint)
      ..restore();
  }
}

```

In this example:

- A fragment shader (`pixelation.frag`) is loaded and used to apply a pixelation effect.

- The `rasterizeSubtree` method captures the component tree rendering as a texture, which the
  shader uses to generate the pixelated output.

- The effect dynamically changes over time, creating an animated pixelation effect.

This example demonstrates how straightforward it is to add visual effects to your Flame game using
the post-processing system.

```{flutter-app}
:sources: ../flame/examples
:page: post_process
:show: widget code infobox
:width: 180
:height: 180
```

The pixelation shader file:

```glsl
#version 460 core

precision highp float;

#include <flutter/runtime_effect.glsl>

uniform vec2 uPixels;
uniform vec2 uSize;
uniform sampler2D uTexture;

out vec4 fragColor;

void main() {
  vec2 uv = FlutterFragCoord().xy / uSize;
  vec2 puv = round(uv * uPixels) / uPixels;
  fragColor = texture(uTexture, puv);
}
```

## Advanced Example: Crystal Ball

For a more advanced use case of post processing, check out the
[Crystal Ball example](https://examples.flame-engine.org/), which demonstrates camera-level post
processing and chaining multiple effects using `PostProcessSequentialGroup`.

![Crystal Ball Example](../images/crystal_ball.png)

Here's how multiple post-processing effects are combined on a camera:

```dart
class CrystalBallGame extends FlameGame<CrystalBallGameWorld> {

  CrystalBallGame() : super(
          camera: CameraComponent.withFixedResolution(
            width: kCameraSize.x,
            height: kCameraSize.y,
          ),
          world: CrystalBallGameWorld(),
        ) {
    camera.postProcess = PostProcessGroup(
      postProcesses: [
        PostProcessSequentialGroup(
          postProcesses: [
            FireflyPostProcess(),
            WaterPostProcess(),
          ],
        ),
        ForegroundFogPostProcess(),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

In this code:

- The camera applies a `PostProcessGroup` containing multiple effects.
- `PostProcessSequentialGroup` chains two effects (`FireflyPostProcess` and `WaterPostProcess`)
  sequentially.
- An additional parallel effect (`ForegroundFogPostProcess`) is applied alongside the sequential
  group.

# Rendering

Rendering is how your game draws everything the player sees: sprites, text, particle effects, and
custom shapes. Flame builds on Flutter's
[Canvas](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-ui/Canvas-class.html) API and adds game-oriented utilities
for loading sprite sheets, animating frames, rendering text with bitmap fonts, applying visual
decorators, and running post-processing shaders.

# Text Rendering

Flame has some dedicated classes to help you render text.

## Text Components

The simplest way to render text with Flame is to leverage one of the provided text-rendering
components:

- `TextComponent` for rendering a single line of text
- `TextBoxComponent` for bounding multi-line text within a sized box, including the possibility of a
  typing effect. You can use the `newLineNotifier` to be notified when a new line is added. Use the
  `onComplete` callback to execute a function when the text is completely printed.
- `ScrollTextBoxComponent` enhances the functionality of `TextBoxComponent` by adding vertical
  scrolling capability when the text exceeds the boundaries of the enclosing box.

All components are showcased in [this example](https://github.com/flame-engine/flame/blob/main/examples/lib/stories/rendering/text_example.dart).

### TextComponent

`TextComponent` is a simple component that renders a single line of text.

Simple usage:

```dart
class MyGame extends FlameGame {
  @override
  void onLoad() {
    add(
      TextComponent(
        text: 'Hello, Flame',
        position: Vector2.all(16.0),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In order to configure aspects of the rendering like font family, size, color, etc, you need to
provide (or amend) a `TextRenderer` with such information; while you can read more details about
this interface below, the simplest implementation you can use is the `TextPaint`, which takes a
Flutter `TextStyle`:

```dart
final regular = TextPaint(
  style: TextStyle(
    fontSize: 48.0,
    color: BasicPalette.white.color,
  ),
);

class MyGame extends FlameGame {
  @override
  void onLoad() {
    add(
      TextComponent(
        text: 'Hello, Flame',
        textRenderer: regular,
        anchor: Anchor.topCenter,
        position: Vector2(size.width / 2, 32.0),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

You can find all the options under [TextComponent's
API](https://pub.dev/documentation/flame/latest/components/TextComponent-class.html).

### TextBoxComponent

`TextBoxComponent` is very similar to `TextComponent`, but as its name suggest it is used to render
text inside a bounding box, creating line breaks according to the provided box size.

You can decide if the box should grow as the text is written or if it should be static by the
`growingBox` variable in the `TextBoxConfig`. A static box could either have a fixed size (setting
the `size` property of the `TextBoxComponent`), or to automatically shrink to fit the text content.

In addition, the `align` property allows you to control the horizontal and vertical alignment of
the text content. For example, setting `align` to `Anchor.center` will center the text within its
bounding box both vertically and horizontally.

If you want to change the margins of the box use the `margins` variable in the `TextBoxConfig`.

Finally, if you want to simulate a "typing" effect, by showing each character of the string one by
one as if being typed in real-time, you can provide the `boxConfig.timePerChar` parameter.

To control the typing effect, call `skip` to show the entire text at once, and `resetAnimation` to
reset the typing effect back to the beginning without having to recreate the component. Do note
that `skip` sets `boxConfig.timePerChar` to `0` so when attempting to replay the typing effect
after calling `skip`, make sure to re-set the `boxConfig.timePerChar` right before or after
calling `resetAnimation`.

Example usage:

```dart
class MyTextBox extends TextBoxComponent {
  MyTextBox(String text) : super(
    text: text,
    textRenderer: tiny,
    boxConfig: TextBoxConfig(timePerChar: 0.05),
  );

  final bgPaint = Paint()..color = Color(0xFFFF00FF);
  final borderPaint = Paint()..color = Color(0xFF000000)..style = PaintingStyle.stroke;

  @override
  void render(Canvas canvas) {
    Rect rect = Rect.fromLTWH(0, 0, width, height);
    canvas.drawRect(rect, bgPaint);
    canvas.drawRect(rect.deflate(boxConfig.margin), borderPaint);
    super.render(canvas);
  }
}
```

You can find all the options under [TextBoxComponent's
API](https://pub.dev/documentation/flame/latest/components/TextBoxComponent-class.html).

### ScrollTextBoxComponent

The `ScrollTextBoxComponent` is an advanced version of the `TextBoxComponent`,
designed for displaying scrollable text within a defined area.
This component is particularly useful for creating interfaces where large amounts of text
need to be presented in a constrained space, such as dialogues or information panels.

Note that the `align` property of `TextBoxComponent` is not available.

Example usage:

```dart
class MyScrollableText extends ScrollTextBoxComponent {
  MyScrollableText(Vector2 frameSize, String text) : super(
    size: frameSize,
    text: text,
    textRenderer: regular,
    boxConfig: TextBoxConfig(timePerChar: 0.05),
  );
}
```

### TextElementComponent

If you want to render an arbitrary TextElement, ranging from a single InlineTextElement to a
formatted DocumentRoot, you can use the `TextElementComponent`.

A simple example is to create a DocumentRoot to render a sequence of block elements (think of an
HTML "div") containing rich text:

```dart
  final document = DocumentRoot([
    HeaderNode.simple('1984', level: 1),
    ParagraphNode.simple(
      'Anything could be true. The so-called laws of nature were nonsense.',
    ),
    // ...
  ]);
  final element = TextElementComponent.fromDocument(
    document: document,
    position: Vector2(100, 50),
    size: Vector2(400, 200),
  );
```

Note that the size can be specified in two ways; either via:

- the size property common to all `PositionComponents`; or
- the width/height included within the `DocumentStyle` applied.

An example applying a style to the document (which can include the size but other parameters as
well):

```dart
  final style = DocumentStyle(
    width: 400,
    height: 200,
    padding: const EdgeInsets.symmetric(vertical: 10, horizontal: 14),
    background: BackgroundStyle(
      color: const Color(0xFF4E322E),
      borderColor: const Color(0xFF000000),
      borderWidth: 2.0,
    ),
  );
  final document = DocumentRoot([ ... ]);
  final element = TextElementComponent.fromDocument(
    document: document,
    style: style,
    position: Vector2(100, 50),
  );
```

See a more elaborate [example of rich-text, formatted
text blocks rendering](https://github.com/flame-engine/flame/blob/main/examples/lib/stories/rendering/rich_text_example.dart).

For more details about the underlying mechanics of the text rendering pipeline, see "Text Elements,
Text Nodes, and Text Styles" below.

### Flame Markdown

In order to more easily create rich-text-based DocumentRoots, from simple strings with bold/italics
to complete structured documents, Flame provides the `flame_markdown` bridge package that connects
the `markdown` library with Flame's text rendering infrastructure.

Just use the `FlameMarkdown` helper class and the `toDocument` method to convert a markdown string
into a DocumentRoot (which can then be used to create a `TextElementComponent`):

```dart
import 'package:flame/text.dart';
import 'package:flame_markdown/flame_markdown.dart';

// ...
final component = await TextElementComponent.fromDocument(
  document: FlameMarkdown.toDocument(
    '# Header\n'
    '\n'
    'This is a **bold** text, and this is *italic*.\n'
    '\n'
    'This is a second paragraph.\n',
  ),
  style: ...,
  position: ...,
  size: ...,
);
```

## Infrastructure

If you are not using the Flame Component System, want to understand the infrastructure behind text
rendering, want to customize fonts and styles used, or want to create your own custom renderers,
this section is for you.

- `TextRenderer`: renderers know "how" to render text; in essence they contain the style information
  to render any string
- `TextElement`: an element is formatted, "laid-out" piece of text, include the string ("what") and
  the style ("how")

The following diagram showcases the class and inheritance structure of the text rendering pipeline:

```{mermaid}
%%{init: { 'theme': 'dark' } }%%
classDiagram
    %% renderers
    note for TextRenderer "This just the style (how).
    It knows how to take a text string and create a TextElement.
    `render` is just a helper to `format(text).render(...)`. Same for `getLineMetrics`."
    class TextRenderer {
        TextElement format(String text)
        LineMetrics getLineMetrics(String text)
        void render(Canvas canvas, String text, ...)
    }
    class TextPaint
    class SpriteFontRenderer
    class DebugTextRenderer

    %% elements
    class TextElement {
        LineMetrics metrics
        render(Canvas canvas, ...)
    }
    class TextPainterTextElement

    TextRenderer --> TextPaint
    TextRenderer --> SpriteFontRenderer
    TextRenderer --> DebugTextRenderer

    TextRenderer *-- TextElement
    TextPaint *-- TextPainterTextElement
    SpriteFontRenderer *-- SpriteFontTextElement

    note for TextElement "This is the text (what) and the style (how);
    laid out and ready to render."
    TextElement --> TextPainterTextElement
    TextElement --> SpriteFontTextElement
    TextElement --> Others
```

### TextRenderer

`TextRenderer` is the abstract class used by Flame to render text. Implementations of `TextRenderer`
must include the information about the "how" the text is rendered. Font style, size, color, etc. It
should be able to combine that information with a given string of text, via the `format` method, to
generate a `TextElement`.

Flame provides two concrete implementations:

- `TextPaint`: most used, uses Flutter `TextPainter` to render regular text
- `SpriteFontRenderer`: uses a `SpriteFont` (a sprite sheet-based font) to render bitmap text
- `DebugTextRenderer`: only intended to be used for Golden Tests

But you can also provide your own if you want to extend to other customized forms of text rendering.

The main job of a `TextRenderer` is to format a string of text into a `TextElement`, that then can
be rendered onto the screen:

```dart
final textElement = textRenderer.format("Flame is awesome")
textElement.render(...)
```

However the renderer provides a helper method to directly create the element and render it:

```dart
textRenderer.render(
  canvas,
  'Flame is awesome',
  Vector2(10, 10),
  anchor: Anchor.topCenter,
);
```

#### TextPaint

`TextPaint` is the built-in implementation of text rendering in Flame. It is based on top of
Flutter's `TextPainter` class (hence the name), and it can be configured by the style class
`TextStyle`, which contains all typographical information required to render text; i.e., font size
and color, font family, etc.

Outside of the style you can also optionally provide one extra parameter which is the
`textDirection` (but that is typically already set to `ltr` or left-to-right).

Example usage:

```dart
const TextPaint textPaint = TextPaint(
  style: TextStyle(
    fontSize: 48.0,
    fontFamily: 'Awesome Font',
  ),
);
```

Note: there are several packages that contain the class `TextStyle`. We export the right one (from
Flutter) via the `text` module:

```dart
import 'package:flame/text.dart';
```

But if you want to import it explicitly, make sure that you import it from
`package:flutter/painting.dart` (or from material or widgets). If you also need to import `dart:ui`,
you might need to hide its version of `TextStyle`, since that module contains a different class with
the same name:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/painting.dart';
import 'dart:ui' hide TextStyle;
```

Following are some common properties of `TextStyle`(see the [full
list of `TextStyle` properties](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/painting/TextStyle-class.html)):

- `fontFamily`: a commonly available font, like Arial (default), or a custom font added in your
  pubspec (see [how to add a custom font](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/design/fonts)).
- `fontSize`: font size, in pts (default `24.0`).
- `height`: height of text line, as a multiple of font size (default `null`).
- `color`: the color, as a `ui.Color` (default white).

For more information regarding colors and how to create them, see the [Colors and
Palette](palette.md) guide.

#### SpriteFontRenderer

The other renderer option provided out of the box is `SpriteFontRenderer`, which allows you to
provide a `SpriteFont` based off of a sprite sheet. TODO

#### DebugTextRenderer

This renderer is intended to be used for Golden Tests. Rendering normal font-based text in Golden
Tests is unreliable due to differences in font definitions across platforms and different algorithms
used for anti-aliasing. This renderer will render text as if each word was a solid rectangle, making
it possible to test the layout, positioning and sizing of the elements without having to rely on
font-based rendering.

## Inline Text Elements

A `TextElement` is a "pre-compiled", formatted and laid-out piece of text with a specific styling
applied, ready to be rendered at any given position.

A `InlineTextElement` implements the `TextElement` interface and must implement their two methods,
one that teaches how to translate it around and another on how to draw it to the canvas:

```dart
  void translate(double dx, double dy);
  void draw(Canvas canvas);
```

These methods are intended to be overwritten by the implementations of `InlineTextElement`, and
probably will not be called directly by users; because a convenient `render` method is provided:

```dart
  void render(
    Canvas canvas,
    Vector2 position, {
    Anchor anchor = Anchor.topLeft,
  })
```

That allows the element to be rendered at a specific position, using a given anchor.

The interface also mandates (and provides) a getter for the `LineMetrics` object associated with
that `InlineTextElement`, which allows you (and the `render` implementation) to access sizing
information related to the element (width, height, ascend, etc).

```dart
  LineMetrics get metrics;
```

## Text Elements, Text Nodes, and Text Styles

While normal renderers always work with a `InlineTextElement` directly, there is a bigger underlying
infrastructure that can be used to render more rich or formatter text.

Text Elements are a superset of Inline Text Elements that represent an arbitrary rendering block
within a rich-text document. Essentially, they are concrete and "physical": they are objects that
are ready to be rendered on a canvas.

This property distinguishes them from Text Nodes, which are structured pieces of text, and from Text
Styles (called `FlameTextStyle` in code to make it easier to work alongside Flutter's `TextStyle`),
which are descriptors for how arbitrary pieces of text ought to be rendered.

So, in the most general case, a user would use a `TextNode` to describe a desired piece of rich
text; define a `FlameTextStyle` to apply to it; and use that to generate a `TextElement`. Depending
on the type of rendering, the `TextElement` generated will be an `InlineTextElement`, which brings
us back to the normal flow of the rendering pipeline. The unique property of the Inline-Text-type
element is that it exposes a LineMetrics that can be used for advanced rendering; while the other
elements only expose a simpler `draw` method which is unaware of sizing and positioning.

However, the other types of Text Elements, Text Nodes, and Text Styles must be used if the intent is
to create an entire document (multiple blocks or paragraphs), enriched with formatted text. In order
to render an arbitrary TextElement, you can alternatively use the `TextElementComponent` (see above).

See [examples of such usage](https://github.com/flame-engine/flame/blob/main/examples/lib/stories/rendering/rich_text_example.dart).

### Text Nodes and the Document Root

A `DocumentRoot` is not a `TextNode` (inheritance-wise) in itself but represents a grouping of
`BlockNodes` that layout a "page" or "document" of rich text laid out in multiple blocks or
paragraphs. It represents the entire document and can receive a global Style.

The first step to define your rich-text document is to create a Node, which will likely be a
`DocumentRoot`.

It will first contain the top-most list of Block Nodes that can define headers, paragraphs or
columns.

Then each of those blocks can contain other blocks or the Inline Text Nodes, either Plain Text Nodes
or some rich-text with specific formatting.

Note that the hierarchy defined by the node structure is also used for styling purposes as per
defined in the `FlameTextStyle` class.

The actual nodes all inherit from `TextNode` and are broken down by the following diagram:

```{mermaid}
%%{init: { 'theme': 'dark' } }%%
graph TD
    %% Config %%
    classDef default fill:#282828,stroke:#F6BE00;

    %% Nodes %%
    TextNode("
        <big><strong>TextNode</strong></big>
        Can be thought of as an HTML DOM node;
        each subclass can be thought of as a specific tag.
    ")
    BlockNode("
        <big><strong>BlockNode</strong></big>
        #quot;div#quot;
    ")
    InlineTextNode("
        <big><strong>InlineTextNode</strong></big>
        #quot;span#quot;
    ")
    ColumnNode("
        <big><strong>ColumnNode</strong></big>
        column-arranged group of other Block Nodes
    ")
    TextBlockNode("
        <big><strong>TextBlockNode</strong></big>
        a #quot;div#quot; with an InlineTextNode as a direct child
    ")
    HeaderNode("
        <big><strong>HeaderNode</strong></big>
        #quot;h1#quot; / #quot;h2#quot; / etc
    ")
    ParagraphNode("
        <big><strong>ParagraphNode</strong></big>
        #quot;p#quot;
    ")
    GroupTextNode("
        <big><strong>GroupTextNode</strong></big>
        groups other TextNodes in a single line
    ")
    PlainTextNode("
        <big><strong>PlainTextNode</strong></big>
        just plain text, unformatted
    ")
    ItalicTextNode("
        <big><strong>ItalicTextNode</strong></big>
        #quot;i#quot; / #quot;em#quot;
    ")
    BoldTextNode("
        <big><strong>BoldTextNode</strong></big>
        #quot;b#quot; / #quot;strong#quot;
    ")
    TextNode ----> BlockNode
    TextNode --------> InlineTextNode
    BlockNode --> ColumnNode
    BlockNode --> TextBlockNode
    TextBlockNode --> HeaderNode
    TextBlockNode --> ParagraphNode
    InlineTextNode --> GroupTextNode
    InlineTextNode --> PlainTextNode
    InlineTextNode --> BoldTextNode
    InlineTextNode --> ItalicTextNode
```

### (Flame) Text Styles

Text Styles can be applied to nodes to generate elements. They all inherit from `FlameTextStyle`
abstract class (which is named as is to avoid confusion with Flutter's `TextStyle`).

They follow a tree-like structure, always having `DocumentStyle` as the root; this structure is
leveraged to apply cascading style to the analogous Node structure. In fact, they are pretty similar
to, and can be thought of as, CSS definitions.

The full inheritance chain can be seen on the following diagram:

```{mermaid}
%%{init: { 'theme': 'dark' } }%%
classDiagram
    %% Nodes %%
    class FlameTextStyle {
        copyWith()
        merge()
    }

    note for FlameTextStyle "Root for all styles.
    Not to be confused with Flutter's TextStyle."

    class DocumentStyle {
        <<for the entire Document Root>>
        size
        padding
        background [BackgroundStyle]
        specific styles [for blocks & inline]
    }

    class BlockStyle {
        <<for Block Nodes>>
        margin, padding
        background [BackgroundStyle]
        text [InlineTextStyle]
    }

    class BackgroundStyle {
        <<for Block or Document>>
        color
        border
    }

    class InlineTextStyle {
        <<for any nodes>>
        font, color
    }

    FlameTextStyle <|-- DocumentStyle
    FlameTextStyle <|-- BlockStyle
    FlameTextStyle <|-- BackgroundStyle
    FlameTextStyle <|-- InlineTextStyle
```

### Text Elements

Finally, we have the elements, that represent a combination of a node ("what") with a style ("how"),
and therefore represent a pre-compiled, laid-out piece of rich text to be rendered on the Canvas.

Inline Text Elements specifically can alternatively be thought of as a combination of a
`TextRenderer` (simplified "how") and a string (single line of "what").

That is because an `InlineTextStyle` can be converted to a specific `TextRenderer` via the
`asTextRenderer` method, which is then used to lay out each line of text into a unique
`InlineTextElement`.

When using the renderer directly, the entire layout process is skipped, and a single
`TextPainterTextElement` or `SpriteFontTextElement` is returned.

As you can see, both definitions of an Element are, essentially, equivalent, all things considered.
But it still leaves us with two paths for rendering text. Which one to pick? How to solve this
conundrum?

When in doubt, the following guidelines can help you picking the best path for you:

- for the simplest way to render text, use `TextPaint` (basic renderer implementation)
  - you can use the FCS provided component `TextComponent` for that.
- for rendering Sprite Fonts, you must use `SpriteFontRenderer` (a renderer implementation that
  accepts a `SpriteFont`);
- for rendering multiple lines of text, with automatic line breaks, you have two options:
  - use the FCS `TextBoxComponent`, which uses any text renderer to draw each line of text as an
    Element, and does its own layout and line breaking;
  - use the Text Node & Style system to create your pre-laid-out Elements. Note: there is no current
    FCS component for it.
- finally, in order to have formatted (or rich) text, you must use Text Nodes & Styles.

# Jenny

The **jenny** library is a toolset for adding _dialogue_ into a game. The dialogue may be quite
complex, including user-controlled interactions, branching, dynamically-generated content, commands,
markup, state controlled either from Jenny or from the game, custom functions and commands, etc.
The `jenny` library is an unofficial port of the [Yarn Spinner] library for Unity. The name of the
library comes from [spinning jenny], a kind of yarn-spinning machine.

Adding dialogue into any game generally consists of two stages:

1. Writing the text of the dialogue;
2. Interactively displaying it within the game.

With `jenny`, these two tasks are completely separate, allowing the creation of game content and
development of the game engine to be independent.

[Yarn Spinner]: https://docs.yarnspinner.dev/
[spinning jenny]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinning_jenny

## Writing dialogue

In `jenny`, the dialogue is written in plain text and stored in `.yarn` files that are added
to the game as assets. The `.yarn` file format is developed by the authors of [Yarn Spinner], and
is specifically designed for writing dialogue.

The simplest form of the yarn dialogue looks like a play:

```yarn
title: Scene1_Gregory_and_Sampson
---
Sampson: Gregory, on my word, we'll not carry coals.
Gregory: No, for then we should be colliers.
Sampson: I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.
Gregory: Ay, while you live, draw your neck out of collar.
Sampson: I strike quickly being moved.
Gregory: But thou art not quickly moved to strike.

```

This simple exchange, when rendered within a game, will be shown as a sequence of phrases spoken
in turn by the two characters. The `DialogRunner` will allow you to control whether the dialogue
proceeds automatically or requires "clicking-through" by the user.

The `.yarn` format supports many more advanced features too, allowing the dialogue to proceed
non-linearly, supporting variables and conditional execution, giving the player an ability to
select their response, etc. Most importantly, the format is so intuitive that it can be generally
understood without having to learn it:

```yarn
title: Slughorn_encounter
---
<<if visited("Horcrux_question")>>
  Slughorn: Sorry, Tom, I don't have time right now.
  <<stop>>
<<endif>>

Slughorn: Oh hello, Tom, is there anything I can help you with?
Tom: Good {time_of_day()}, Professor.
-> I was curious about the 12 uses of the dragon blood.
    Slughorn: Such an inquisitive mind! You can read about that in the "Moste \
              Potente Potions" in the Restricted Section of the library.
    <<give restricted_library_pass>>
    Tom: Thank you, Professor, this is very munificent of you.
-> I wanted to ask... about Horcruxes <<if $knows_about_horcruxes>>
    <<jump Horcrux_question>>
-> I just wanted to say how much I always admire your lectures.
    Slughorn: Thank you, Tom. I do enjoy flattery, even if it is well-deserved.
===

title: Horcrux_question
---
Slughorn: Where... did you hear that?
-> Tom: It was mentioned in an old book in the library...
    Slughorn: I see that you have read more books from the Restricted Section \
              than is wise.
    Slughorn: I'm sorry, Tom, I should have seen you'd be tempted...
    <<take restricted_library_pass>>
    -> But Professor!..
        Slughorn: This is for your good, Tom. Many of those books are dangerous!
        Slughorn: Now off you go. And do your best to forget about what you \
                  asked...
        <<stop>>
-> Tom: I overheard it... And the word felt sharp and frigid, like it was the \
   embodiment of Dark Art <<if luck() >= 80>>
    Slughorn: It is a very Dark Art indeed, it is not good for you to know \
              about it...
    Tom: But if I don't know about this Dark Art, how can I defend myself \
         against it?
    Slughorn: It is a Ritual, one of the darkest known to wizard-kind ...
    ...
    <<achievement "The Darkest Secret">>

```

This fragment demonstrates many of the features of the `.yarn` language, including:

- ability to divide the text into smaller chunks called _nodes_;
- control the flow of the dialog via commands such as `<<if>>` or `<<jump>>`;
- different dialogue path depending on player's choices;
- disable certain menu choices dynamically;
- keep state information in variables;
- user-defined functions (`time_of_day`, `luck`) and commands (`<<give>>`, `<<take>>`).

For more information, see the [Yarn Language](language/language.md) section.

## Using the dialogue in a game

By itself, the `jenny` library does not integrate with any game engine. However, it provides a
runtime that can be used to build such an integration. This runtime consists of the following
components:

- [`YarnProject`](runtime/yarn_project.md) -- the central repository of information, which knows
  about all your yarn scripts, variables, custom functions and commands, settings, etc.
- [`DialogueRunner`](runtime/dialogue_runner.md) -- an executor that can run a specific dialogue
  node. This executor will send the dialogue lines into one or more `DialogueView`s.
- [`DialogueView`](runtime/dialogue_view.md) -- an abstract interface describing how the dialogue
  will be presented to the end user. Implementing this interface is the primary way of integrating
  `jenny` into a specific environment.

# YarnSpinner language

**YarnSpinner** is the language in which `.yarn` files are written. You can check out the
[official documentation] for the YarnSpinner language, however, here we will be describing the
**Jenny** implementation, which may not contain all the original features, but may also contain
some that were not implemented in the YarnSpinner yet.

## Yarn files

Any Yarn project will contain one or more `.yarn` files. These are plain text files in UTF-8
encoding. As such, they can be edited in any text editor or IDE.

Having multiple `.yarn` files helps you better organize your project, but Jenny doesn't impose any
requirements on the number of files or their relationship.

Each `.yarn` file may contain **comments**, **tags**, **[commands]**, and **[nodes]**.
For example:

```yarn
// This is a comment
// The line below, however, is a tag:
# Chapter 1d

<<declare $visited_graveyard = false>>
<<declare $money = 25>>  // is this too much?

title: Start
---
// Node content
===
```

### Comments

A comment starts with `//` and continues until the end of the line. All the text inside a comment
will be completely ignored by Jenny as if it wasn't there.

There are no multi-line comments in YarnSpinner.

### Tags

File-level tags start with a `#` and continue until the end of the line. A tag can be used to
include some per-file custom project metadata. These tags are not interpreted by Jenny in any way.

### Commands

The commands are explained in more details [later][commands], but at this point it is
worth pointing out that only a limited number of commands are allowed at the root level of a file
(that is, outside of nodes). Currently, these commands are:

- `<<declare>>`
- `<<character>>`

The commands outside of nodes are compile-time instructions, that is they are executed during the
compilation of a YarnProject.

### Nodes

Nodes represent the main bulk of content in a yarn file, and are explained in a dedicated
[section][nodes]. There could be multiple nodes in a single file, placed one after another.
No special separator is needed between nodes: as soon as one node ends, the next one can begin.

```{toctree}
:hidden:

Nodes        <nodes.md>
Lines        <lines.md>
Options      <options.md>
Commands     <commands/commands.md>
Expressions  <expressions/expressions.md>
Markup       <markup.md>
```

## File: other_modules/jenny/language/lines.md

---

# Lines

A **line** is the most common element of the Yarn dialogue. It's just a single phrase that a
character in the game says. In a `.yarn` file, a **line** is represented by a single line of text
in a [node body]. A line may contain the following elements:

- A character ID;
- Normal text;
- Escaped text;
- Interpolated expressions;
- Markup;
- Hashtags;
- A comment at the end of the line;
- (a line, however, cannot contain commands).

A **line** is represented with the [DialogueLine] class in Jenny runtime.

## Character ID

If a line starts with a single word followed by a `:`, then that word is presumed to be the name
of the character who is speaking that line. In the following example there are two characters
talking to each other: Prosser and Ford, and the last line has no character ID.

```yarn
title: Bulldozer_Conversation
---
Prosser: You want me to come and lie there...
Ford: Yes
Prosser: In front of the bulldozer?
Ford: Yes
Prosser: In the mud.
Ford: In, as you say, the mud.
(low rumbling noise...)
===
```

It is worth emphasizing that a character ID must be a valid ID -- that is, it cannot contain
spaces or other special characters. In the example below "Harry Potter" is not a valid character ID,
while all other alternatives are ok.

```yarn
title: Hello
---
Harry Potter: Hello, Hermione!
Harry_Potter: Hello, Hermione!
HarryPotter: Hello, Hermione!
Harry: Hello, Hermione!
===
```

If you want to have a line that starts with a `WORD + ':'`, but you don't want that word to be
interpreted as a character name, then the colon can be [escaped](#escaped-text):

```yarn
title: Warning
---
Attention\: The cake is NOT a lie
===
```

```{note}
All characters must be **declared** using the [\<\<character\>\>] command
before they can be used in a script.
```

## Interpolated expressions

You can insert dynamic text into a line with the help of **interpolated expression**s. These
expressions are surrounded with curly braces `{}`, and everything inside the braces will be
evaluated, and then the result of the evaluation will be inserted into the text.

```yarn
title: Greeting
---
Trader: Hello, {$player_name}! Would you like to see my wares?
Player: I have only {plural($money, "% coin")}, do you have anything I can afford?
===
```

The expressions will be evaluated at runtime when the line is delivered, which means it can produce
different text during different runs of the line.

```yarn
title: Exam_Greeting
---
<<if $n_attempts == 0>>
  Professor: Welcome to the exam!
  <<jump Exam>>
<<elseif $n_attempts < 5>>
  Professor: You have tried {plural($n_attempts, "% time")} already, but I \
             can give you another try.
  <<jump Exam>>
<<else>>
  Professor: You've failed 5 times in a row! How is this even possible?
<<endif>>
===
```

After evaluation, the text of the expression will be inserted into the line as-is, without any
further processing. Which means that the text of the expression may contain special characters
(such as `[`, `]`, `{`, `}`, `\`, etc), and they don't need to be escaped. It also means that the
expression cannot contain markup, or produce a hashtag, etc.

Read more about expressions in the [Expressions] section.

## Markup

The **markup** is a mechanism for text annotation. It is somewhat similar to HTML tags, except that
it uses square brackets `[]` instead of angular ones:

```yarn
title: Markup
---
Wizard: No, no, no! [em]This is insanity![/em]
===
```

The markup tags do not alter the text of the line, they merely insert annotations in it. Thus, the
line above will be delivered in game as "No, no, no! This is insanity!", however there will be
additional information attached to the line that shows that the last 17 characters were marked with
the `em` tag.

Markup tags can be nested, or be zero-width, they can also include parameters whose values can be
dynamic. Read more about this in the [Markup] document.

## Hashtags

Hashtags may appear at the end of the line, and take the following form: `#text`. That is, a hashtag
is a `#` symbol followed by any text that doesn't contain whitespace.

Hashtags are used to add line-level metadata. There can be no line content after a hashtag (though
comments are allowed). A line can have multiple hashtags associated with it.

<!-- cSpell:ignore HPMOR (Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality) -->

```yarn
title: Hashtags
---
Harry: There is no justice in the laws of Nature, Headmaster, no term for \
       fairness in the equations of motion. #sad // HPMOR.39
Harry: The universe is neither evil, nor good, it simply does not care.
Harry: The stars don't care, or the Sun, or the sky.
Harry: But they don't have to! We care! #elated #volume:+1
Harry: There is light in the world, and it is us! #volume:+2
===
```

In most cases the Jenny engine does not interpret the tags, but merely stores them as part of the
line information. It is up to the programmer to examine these tags at runtime.

## Escaped text

Whenever you have a line that needs to include a character that would normally be interpreted as
one of the special syntaxes mentioned above, then such a character can be **escaped** with a
backslash `\`.

The following escape sequences are recognized: `\\`, `\/`, `\#`, `\<`, `\>`, `\[`, `\]`, `\{`, `\}`,
`\:`, `\-`, `\n`. In addition, there is also `\⏎` (i.e. backslash followed immediately by a
newline).

```yarn
title: Escapes
---
\// This is not a comment  // but this is
This is not a \#hashtag
This is not a \<<command>>
\{This line\} does not contain an expression
Not a \[markup\]
===
```

The `\⏎` escape can be used to split a single long line into multiple physical lines, that would
still be treated by Jenny as if it was a single line. This escape sequence consumes both the
newline symbol and all the whitespace at the start of the next line:

```yarn
title: One_long_line
---
This line is so long that it becomes uncomfortable to read in a text editor. \
    Therefore, we use the backslash-newline escape sequence to split it into \
    several physical lines. The indentation at the start of the continuation \
    lines is for convenience only, and will be removed from the resulting \
    text.

# Markup

**Markup** is a mechanism for annotating fragments of a dialogue line. They are somewhat similar to
HTML tags, or you can imagine them as comments in a google document. Importantly, markup tags
only annotate the text, but do not alter its content or display in the game. It is up to the
developer to actually use the markup information in their game.

## Syntax

Markup tags are denoted with the name of the tag, placed in square brackets: `[tag_name]`. The
corresponding closing tag would be `[/tag_name]`. Every markup tag must have a corresponding
closing tag:

```yarn
Hello, [wavy]world[/wavy]!
```

Markup tags may nest within each other, though they must nest properly, in the sense that one
markup range must be fully inside or fully outside another:

```yarn
Lorem [S]ipsum dolor [A]sit[/A] amet[/S], consectetur [B]adipiscing[/B] elit
```

The special **close-all** markup tag `[/]` closes all currently opened markup ranges. It is also
handy in situations where the name of the markup tag is long and you don't want to repeat it:

```yarn
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, [bold]consectetur adipiscing elit[/]
```

The **self-closing** markup tags have the form `[tag_name/]`. These tags mark a single location
within the text. In addition, if such tag is surrounded by spaces on both sides, then a single
space after the tag will be removed from the resulting text. If this is undesired, then simply
add an extra space after the markup tag:

```yarn
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, [wave/] consectetur adipiscing elit.
```

Markup tags also accept parameters, which are similar to HTML tag attributes. The names of these
parameters can be arbitrary IDs, and the values are expressions that will be evaluated each time
the line is executed. Thus, the values of attributes can be dynamic:

```yarn
Lorem ipsum [color name=$color]dolor sit amet[/color]
```

Markup tags can surround dynamic text (interpolated expressions), which will cause the length of
the marked up span to be different every time the line is run. At the same time, markup cannot be
generated dynamically -- in the sense that the interpolated expressions will always be inserted
as-is, even if they contain some text in square brackets.

```yarn
Hello, [b]{$player}[/b]!
```

Lastly, it should be noted that if you want to have an actual text in square brackets within a
line, then in order to prevent it from being parsed as markup you can escape the square brackets
with a backslash `\`:

```yarn
Hello, \[world\]!
```

```{seealso}
- [MarkupAttribute](../runtime/markup_attribute.md): the runtime representation
  of a markup attribute within a line.
```

## Examples

### Mark a piece of text with a different style

In this example the word "Voldemort" is rendered with a special "cursed" markup, indicating that
the word itself is cursed (it is up to you how to actually render this in a game). Similarly, the
word "stupid" in the second line has an emphasis, which may be rendered as italic text.

```yarn
title: Scene117_Harry_MrMalfoy
---
Harry: I'm not afraid of [cursed]Voldemort[/cursed]!
MrMalfoy: You must be really brave... or really [i]stupid[/i]?
===
```

### Provide additional information about a text fragment

In this example the word "Llewellyn" has a tooltip information associated with it. A game might
render this with a special style suggesting that the user may hover over that word to see a
tooltip with a minimap for where to find this NPC.

```yarn
title: MonkDialogue
---
Monk: Visit [tooltip place="TS" x=23 y=-74]Llewellyn[/] in Thunderstorm, \
      he will be able to help you.
===
```

### Indicate where special non-text tokens may be inserted

The `[item/]` markup tag will be replaced by the item's name, which will also be interactive:
tapping this name would bring up the item's description card.

```yarn
title: BlacksmithQuest
---
<<local $reward = if($chapter==1, "A0325", "A1018")>>
Smith: Find me my lost ring, and I'll give you this [item id=$reward/].
===
```

---

## File: other_modules/jenny/language/nodes.md

---

# Nodes

A **node** is a small section of text, that represents a single conversation or interaction with
an NPC. Each node has a **title**, which can be used to _run_ that node in a [DialogueRunner], or to
[jump] to that node from another node.

You can think of a node as if it was a function in a regular programming language. Running a node
is equivalent to calling a function, and it is not possible to start execution in the middle of a
node/function. When a function becomes too large, we will usually want to split it into multiple
smaller ones -- the same is true for nodes, when a node becomes too long it is a good idea to split
it into several smaller nodes.

Each node consists of a **header** and a **body**. The header is separated from the body with 3
(or more) dashes, and the body is terminated with 3 "=" signs:

```yarn
// NODE HEADER
---
// NODE BODY
===
```

In addition, you can use 3 (or more) dashes to separate the header from the previous content, which
means the following is also a valid node:

```yarn
---------------
// NODE HEADER
---------------
// NODE BODY
===
```

A **node** is represented with a [Node] class in Jenny runtime.

[Node]: ../runtime/node.md

## Header

The header of a node consists of one or more lines of the form `TAG: CONTENT`. One of these lines
must contain the node's **title**, which is the name of the node:

```yarn
title: NodeName
```

The title of a node must be a valid ID (that is, starts with a letter, followed by any number of
letters, digits, or underscores). All nodes within a single project must have unique titles.

Besides the title, you can add any number of extra tags into the node's header. Jenny will store
these tags with the node's metadata, but will not interpret them in any other way. You will then
be able to access these tags programmatically

```yarn
title: Alert
colorID: 0
modal: true
---
WARNING\: Entering Radioactive Zone!
===
```

## Body

The body of a node is where the dialogue itself is located. The body is just a sequence of
statements, where each statement is either a [Line], an [Option], or a [Command]. For example:

```yarn
title: Gloomy_Morning
camera_zoom: 2
---
You  : Good morning!
Guard: You call this good? 'Tis as crappy as could be
You  : Why, what happened?
Guard: Don't you see the fog? Chills me through to the bones
You  : Sorry to hear that...
You  : So, can I pass?
Guard: Can I get some exercise cutting you into pieces? Maybe that'll warm me up!
You  : Ok, I think I'll be going. Hope you feel better soon!
===
```

[DialogueRunner]: ../runtime/dialogue_runner.md
[jump]: commands/jump.md
[Line]: lines.md
[Option]: options.md
[Command]: commands/commands.md

---

## File: other_modules/jenny/language/options.md

---

# Options

**Options** are special lines that display a menu of choices for the player, and the player must
select one of them in order to continue. The options are indicated with an arrow `->` at the start
of the line:

```yarn
title: Adventure
---
You arrive at the edge of the forest. The road dives in, but there is another \
one going around the edge.
-> Go straight ahead, on the beaten path (x)
-> Take the road along the forest's edge
-> Turn back
===
```

An option is typically followed by an indented list of statements (which may, again, be lines,
options, or commands). These statements indicate how the dialogue should proceed if the player
chooses that particular option. After the control flow finishes running through the block
corresponding to the selected option, the dialogue resumes after the option set.

Other than the arrow indicator, an option follows the same syntax as the [line]. Thus, it can have
a character name, the main text, interpolated expressions, markup, and hashtags. One additional
feature that an option can have is the **conditional**. A conditional is a short-form `<<if>>`
command after the text of an option (but before the hashtags):

```yarn
title: Bridge
---
Guard: 50 coins and you can cross the bridge.
-> Alright, take the money  <<if $gold >= 50>>
   <<take gold 50>>
   <<grant bridge_pass>>
-> I have so much money, here, take a 100  <<if $gold >= 10000>>
   <<take gold 100>>
   <<grant bridge_pass>>
   Guard: Wow, so generous!
   Guard: But I wouldn't recommend going around telling everyone that you \
          have "so much money"
-> That's too expensive!
   Guard: Is it? My condolences
-> How about I [s]kick your butt[/s] instead?
   <<if $power < 1000>>
      <<fight>>
   <<else>>
      You make a very reasonable point, sir, my apologies.
      <<grant bridge_pass>>
   <<endif>>
===
```

When the conditional evaluates to `true`, the option is delivered to the game normally. If the
conditional turns out to be false, the option is still delivered, but is marked as `unavailable`.
It is up to the game whether to display such option as greyed out, or crossed, or not show it at
all; however, such option cannot be selected.

As you have noticed, options always come in groups: after all, the player must select among several
possible choices. Thus, any sequence of options that are adjacent to each other in the dialogue,
will always be delivered as a single bundle to the frontend. This is called the **choice set**.

## File: other_modules/jenny/language/commands/character.md

---

# `<<character>>`

The **\<\<character\>\>** command declares a character with the given name, and one or more aliases
that can be used in the scripts.

The command has several purposes:

- it protects you from accidentally misspelling a character's name in your script;
- it allows a character to have _full name_, which doesn't have to be an ID;
- it allows declaring multiple aliases for the same character, which can be used in different
  nodes (an alias may even be in a different language than the full name);
- you can associate additional data with each character, which will then be available at runtime.

The format of this command is the following:

```yarn
<<character "FULL NAME" alias1 alias2...>>
```

The _full name_ here is optional: if given, it will be considered _the_ name of the character.
However, if the name is omitted, then the first alias will be considered the true character's name.
Each _alias_ must be a valid ID, and at least one alias must be provided. For example:

```yarn
// A well-mannered seven-year-old girl, who nevertheless always gets into
// all kinds of zany adventures.
<<character Alice>>

// A magical cat known for his ability to grin majestically, and partially
// vanish. He is mad (by his own admission).
<<character "Cheshire Cat" Cat Cheshire>>

// A foul-tempered Queen, who is also a playing card. Described as
// "a blind fury", her favorite saying is "Off with their heads!".
// Not to be confused with Red Queen.
<<character "Queen of Hearts" Queen QoH QH>>
```

After a character is declared, any of its aliases can be used in the script: they will all refer
to the same `Character` object. At the same time, using a character without declaring it first is
not allowed (unless a special flag in `YarnProject` is set to allow this).

```yarn
title: Alice_and_the_Cat
---
Alice: But I don't want to go among mad people.
Cat:   Oh, you can't help that, we're all mad here. I'm mad. You're mad.
Alice: How do you know I'm mad?
Cat:   You must be, or you wouldn't have come here.
Alice: And how do you know that you're mad?
Cat:   To begin with, a dog's not mad. You grant that?
Alice: I suppose so.
Cat:   Well then, you see a dog growls when it's angry, and wags its tail \
       when it's pleased.
Cat:   Now, [i]I[/i] growl when I'm pleased, and wag my tail when I'm angry. \
       Therefore, I'm mad.
Alice: [i]I[/i] call it purring, not growling.
Cat:   Call it what you like.
===
```

# Commands

The **commands** are special instructions surrounded with double angle-brackets: `<<stop>>`. There
are both _built-in_ and _user-defined_ commands.

The **built-in** commands are those that are supported by the YarnSpinner runtime itself. Typically
they would alter the execution of the dialogue, or perform a similar dialogue-related function. The
full list of such commands is given below.

The **user-defined** commands are those that you yourself create and then use within your yarn
scripts. For a full description of these commands, see the document on [user-defined commands].

## Built-in commands

### Variables

**[\<\<character\>\>](character.md)**
: Declares a character (person).

**[\<\<declare\>\>](declare.md)**
: Declares a global variable.

**[\<\<local\>\>](local.md)**
: Declares a local variable.

**[\<\<set\>\>](set.md)**
: Updates the value of a variable (either local or global).

### Control flow

**[\<\<if\>\>](if.md)**
: Conditionally executes certain statements. This is equivalent to the **if** keyword in most
programming languages.

**[\<\<jump\>\>](jump.md)**
: Switches execution to another node.

**[\<\<stop\>\>](stop.md)**
: Stops executing the current node.

**[\<\<visit\>\>](visit.md)**
: Temporarily jumps to another node, and then comes back.

**[\<\<wait\>\>](wait.md)**
: Pauses the dialogue for the specified amount of time.

# `<<declare>>`

The **\<\<declare\>\>** command creates a new global variable and assigns an initial value to it.
After this command is encountered, the declared variable will be available for use anywhere a
variable might be needed, including in inline expressions, other commands, and even other declare
statements.

Unlike most other commands, the `<<declare>>` command is executed at compile time, i.e. when the
yarn scripts are parsed. When the dialogue runs, it has no effect, since by that time the variable
is already initialized and ready for use. For this reason, the `<<declare>>` commands must be
placed outside of nodes, at the root level of the script, making it clear that these commands do
not execute when a node runs.

For example:

```yarn
<<declare $monicker = "boy">>

---------------
title: Greeting
---------------
Teacher: Welcome to the class, {$monicker}!
===
```

Here the `<<declare>>` command introduces a new variable called `$monicker`, of type `String`, and
assigns it an initial value of `"boy"`. Later on, this variable is used inside the "Greeting" node.
By that time, the value of the variable can be anything: it could be changed in some other node, or
by the game itself. The `<<declare>>` statement, however, is necessary to tell Jenny that this is
a valid variable name, and what type it has.

From the project organization standpoint, the recommended approach is to put all the `<<declare>>`
statements into a separate file, and then make sure that this yarn file is parsed first. This will
ensure that all global variables are declared before they are used in subsequent nodes.

If your game supports save-games, then you would probably want to store the values of yarn global
variables too. In this case restoring the saved values should be done _after_ all yarn scripts are
parsed (otherwise the engine will think that a variable is declared twice).

## Syntax

There are several forms of the `<<declare>>` statement. The most common one is the following:

```yarn
<<declare $VARIABLE = EXPRESSION>>
```

Here `$VARIABLE` is the name of the variable being declared (all variables in Yarn start with a `$`
sign), and `EXPRESSION` is either a literal or a more complicated [expression] that will be
evaluated at compile time in order to provide the initial value for the variable. The type of the
variable will be deduced from the type of the `EXPRESSION`.

Another possible syntax for the `<<declare>>` command is this:

```yarn
<<declare $VARIABLE as TYPE>>
```

where `TYPE` is one of `Bool`, `Number`, or `String`. This will create a variable of the given type,
and initialize it with values `false`, `0`, or `""` respectively.

Finally, it is possible to combine these two syntaxes:

```yarn
<<declare $VARIABLE = EXPRESSION as TYPE>>
```

This can be useful when the type of the `EXPRESSION` is not immediately obvious, and you want to
make the declaration more explicit. The compiler will check that the type of the `EXPRESSION` is
the same as `TYPE`, and will throw a compile-time error otherwise.

## Examples

```yarn
<<declare $prefix = "Mr.">>
<<declare $gold = 100>>
<<declare $been_to_hell = false>>

<<declare $name as String>>
<<declare $distanceTraveled as Number>>

<<declare $birthDay = randomRange(1, 365) as Number>>
<<declare $vulgarity = GetObscenitySetting() as Bool>>
```

:::{note}
It is a good idea to accompany each `<<declare>>` with a doc-comment explaining the purpose of the
variable, similarly to how you would document public members of a class.

## File: other_modules/jenny/language/commands/if.md

---

# `<<if>>`

The **\<\<if\>\>** command evaluates its condition, and based on that decides which statements to
execute next. This is equivalent to `if` keyword in most programming languages. This command may
have multiple parts, which look as follows:

```yarn
<<if condition1>>
  statements1...
<<elseif condition2>>
  statements2...
<<else>>
  statementsN...
<<endif>>
```

- The conditions within each command must have boolean type.
- There could be any number of `<<elseif>>` blocks.
- The `<<elseif>>` blocks and `<<else>>` are optional.
- The final `<<endif>>` is mandatory.
- The statements within each block must be indented.

At runtime, the condition within the `if` block is evaluated first. If it turns out to be `true`,
then the dialogue proceeds with executing `statements1`, and no other conditions are evaluated nor
other statement blocks executed. However, if `condition1` evaluated to `false`, then `condition2`
is calculated. If it is true, then the dialogue runner will execute `statements2`, and if false it
will fall-through into the `else` block and execute `statementsN`. In the end, the dialogue will
proceed to statements that occur after the final `<<endif>>`.

## Example

In this dialogue a _Guard_ will greet you differently depending on your reputation with the
citizens of the area. If your reputation falls below −100, you'll be attacked on sight.

```yarn
title: GuardGreeting
---
<<if $reputation >= 100>>
  Guard: Hail to the savior of the people!
<<elseif $reputation >= 30>>
  Guard: Nice to meet you, sir!
<<elseif $reputation >= 0>>
  Guard: Hello
<<elseif $reputation > -30>>
  Guard: I'm keeping an eye on you...
<<elseif $reputation > -100>>
  Guard: You filthy scum!
<<else>>
  Guard: You'll pay for your crimes! #auto
  <<attack>>
<<endif>>

```

## File: other_modules/jenny/language/commands/jump.md

---

# `<<jump>>`

The **\<\<jump\>\>** command stops executing the current node, and then immediately starts running
the target node. This is similar to a `goto` in many programming languages. For example:

```yarn
<<jump FarewellScene>>
```

The argument of this command is the id of the node to jump to. It can be given either as a plain
node ID, or as an expression in curly braces:

```yarn
<<jump {"Ending_" + $ending}>>
```

If the expression evaluates at runtime to an unknown name, then a `NameError` exception will be
thrown.

## See Also

- [\<\<visit\>\>](visit.md) command, which jumps into the destination node temporarily and then
  returns to the same place in the dialogue as before.

---

## File: other_modules/jenny/language/commands/local.md

---

# `<<local>>`

The **\<\<local\>\>** command creates a new variable within the current node, and initializes it
to some starting value. Thus, it is similar to [\<\<declare\>\>][declare], except that the variable
it creates is visible within a single node only.

The syntax of the `<<local>>` command can be one of the following:

```yarn
<<local $VARIABLE = EXPRESSION>>
<<local $VARIABLE = EXPRESSION as TYPE>>
```

This would create a variable with the name `$VARIABLE` (all variables in YarnSpinner start with a
`$` sign), and assign it the value of `EXPRESSION`. In the second form, it will ensure that the
type of the expression is equal to `TYPE`, otherwise a compile-time error will be thrown. Thus, the
second form serves as the explicit annotation for the type of the variable created.

The following restrictions apply:

- each local variable can be declared only once within a node;
- the name of a local variable cannot coincide with the name of any global variable.

## Examples

In this example the variable `$roll` will only be needed temporarily within this one node, so it
wouldn't make sense to declare it as global.

```yarn
title: a_dice_roll
---
<<local $roll = dice(6)>>
<<if $roll == 1>>
  You've rolled 1, rotten luck...
<<elseif $roll == 2>>
  You've rolled 2, which is still below the average. Try harder!
<<elseif $roll == 3>>
  You've rolled 3.14159265 (well, almost).
<<elseif $roll == 4>>
  Your roll is an unlucky number. Please roll again
<<else>>
  You've rolled 10 (when rounded to the nearest ten). Good job!
<<endif>>

## File: other_modules/jenny/language/commands/set.md

---

# `<<set>>`

The **\<\<set\>\>** command is used to update the value of an existing variable. The variable
must be declared with [\<\<declare\>\>][declare] or [\<\<local\>\>][local] before it can be used
in `<<set>>`.

The command `<<set>>` allows either regular assignment, or modifying assignment, like follows:

```yarn
// Regular assignment
<<set $VARIABLE = EXPRESSION>>
<<set $VARIABLE to EXPRESSION>>

// Modifying assignments
<<set $VARIABLE += EXPRESSION>>
<<set $VARIABLE -= EXPRESSION>>
<<set $VARIABLE *= EXPRESSION>>
<<set $VARIABLE /= EXPRESSION>>
<<set $VARIABLE %= EXPRESSION>>

// These modifying assignments are equivalent to the following:
<<set $VARIABLE = $VARIABLE + EXPRESSION>>
<<set $VARIABLE = $VARIABLE - EXPRESSION>>
<<set $VARIABLE = $VARIABLE * EXPRESSION>>
<<set $VARIABLE = $VARIABLE / EXPRESSION>>
<<set $VARIABLE = $VARIABLE % EXPRESSION>>
```

In all cases, the `EXPRESSION` must have the same type as the `$VARIABLE`. If not, a compile-time
error will be thrown.

## Examples

```yarn
<<declare $favorite_color as String>>

title: ColorQuiz
---
What is your favorite color?
-> White
   <<set $favorite_color to "White">>
-> Red
   <<set $favorite_color to "Red">>
-> Yellow
   <<set $favorite_color = "Yellow">>
-> Blue
   Oh, Nice! Which shade of blue?
   -> Azure
   -> Cerulean
   -> Lapis Lazuli
   Umm, I don't know how to spell that. I'll just put you down as "blue".
   <<set $favorite_color = "Blue">>
-> Black
   <<set $favorite_color = "Black">>
   That's mine too!
   <<set $affinity += 3>>
-> Prefer not to tell
   Aww... Maybe if I ask again really nicely?
   <<jump ColorQuiz>>

## File: other_modules/jenny/language/commands/stop.md

---

# `<<stop>>`

The **\<\<stop\>\>** command: immediately stops evaluating the current node, as if you jumped to
its end. This command takes no arguments.

Normally, the effect of this command is that it stops the dialogue. However, if you're only
visiting the current node from a different one, then `<<stop>>` will only exit the current node,
and the execution flow will return to the parent. Thus, the `<<stop>>` command is similar to
`return;` in many programming languages.

```yarn
<<stop>>
```

---

## File: other_modules/jenny/language/commands/user_defined_commands.md

---

# User-defined commands

In addition to the built-in commands, you can also declare your own **user-defined commands** for
use in your yarn scripts. Typically, these commands would perform some in-game action that can be
viewed as a natural part of the dialogue. For example, you can create commands for such action as
`<<wave>>`, `<<smile>>`, `<<frown>>`, `<<moveCamera>>`, `<<zoom>>`, `<<shakeCamera>>`,
`<<fadeOut>>`, `<<walk>>`, `<<give>>`, `<<take>>`, `<<achievement>>`, `<<GainExperience>>`,
`<<startQuest>>`, `<<finishQuest>>`, `<<openTrade>>`, `<<drawWeapon>>`, and so on.

In many cases, the commands will need to take arguments. The arguments of a user-defined command
are processed according to the following rules:

- First, all content after the command name and until the closing `>>` is parsed according to the
  rules of regular line parsing, where interpolated expressions are allowed but markup and hashtags
  are not.
- At runtime, the content of that line is evaluated, meaning that we substitute the values of all
  expressions.
- The evaluated argument string is then broken into individual arguments at whitespace, and the
  types of these arguments are checked against the signature of the backing function.
- Then, the backing function is called with the parsed arguments.
- Lastly, all dialogue views in the dialogue runner receive the `onCommand()` event.

As a concrete example, consider the following command:

```yarn
<<give Gold {round(100 * $multiplier)}>>
```

First note that, unlike builtin commands, the arguments of the command are treated as text, and any
expressions need to be placed in curly brackets.

Then, at runtime the expression is evaluated, and (assuming `$multiplier` is 1.5) the command's
argument string becomes `"Gold 150"`. The string is then broken at white spaces and each argument
is parsed according to its type in the backing Dart function. For example, if the function's
signature is `void give(String item, int amount)`, then it will be invoked as `give("Gold", 150)`.
If, on the other hand, the number or types of arguments do not match the expected signature, then
a `DialogueException` will be raised.

## File: other_modules/jenny/language/commands/visit.md

---

# `<<visit>>`

The **\<\<visit\>\>** command temporarily puts the current node on hold, executes the target node,
and after it finishes, resumes execution of the previous node. This is similar to a function call
in many programming languages.

The `<<visit>>` command can be useful for splitting a large dialogue into several smaller nodes,
or for reusing some common dialogue lines in several nodes. For example:

```yarn
title: RoamingTrader1
---
<<if $roaming_trader_introduced>>
  Hello again, {$player}!
<<else>>
  <<visit RoamingTraderIntro>>
<<endif>>

-> What do you think about the Calamity?  <<if $calamity_started>>
   <<visit RoamingTrader_Calamity>>
-> Have you seen a weird-looking girl running by? <<if $quest_little_girl>>
   <<visit RoamingTrader_LittleGirl>>
-> What do you have for trade?
   <<OpenTrade>>

Pleasure doing business with you! #auto
===
```

The argument of this command is the id of the node to jump to. It can be given either as a plain
node ID, or as an expression in curly braces:

```yarn
<<visit {"RewardChoice_" + string($choice)}>>
```

If the expression evaluates at runtime to an unknown name, then a `NameError` exception will be
thrown.

---

## File: other_modules/jenny/language/commands/wait.md

---

# `<<wait>>`

The **\<\<wait\>\>** command forces the dialogue engine to wait for the specified duration
(in seconds) before resuming the dialogue. The number of seconds can be 0, but cannot be negative.
This command takes a single argument, which must be a numeric expression. For example:

```yarn
// Wait for a quarter of a second
<<wait 0.25>>

// Wait for the amount of time given by the $delay variable
<<wait $delay>>
```

---

## File: other_modules/jenny/language/expressions/expressions.md

---

# Expressions

The **expressions** in YarnSpinner provide a way to dynamically change the flow or the content
of the dialogue, based on [variables], combined with [operators] or [function] calls. They are
used in several places:

- to insert a dynamic text into a [line];
- to create or update a [variable];
- as part of a [command] such as `<<if>>` or `<<set>>`;
- to compute the values of [markup] attributes.

An expression always evaluates synchronously, meaning that it cannot wait for user's input, nor
perform an action over time, nor carry out any computationally intensive calculations in a
different thread. If such functionality is really desired, then it can be achieved via a
[user-defined command] that waits for the calculation to succeed and then stores the result into
some global [variable], which can then be accessed from an expression.

# Operators

The **operators** are special symbols that perform common mathematical operations. For example,
operator `+` performs summation, and thus we can write `$x + $y` to denote the sum of variables
`$x` and `$y`. There are over 20 different operators in YarnSpinner, which can be loosely grouped
into the following categories:

## Operator types

### Arithmetic

The **arithmetic** operators, have the same meaning as in regular math. These apply to numeric
arguments (with the exception of `+` which can also be used with strings):

```{list-table}
:align: left
:class: first-col-align-center
:header-rows: 1
:widths: 1 2 9

* - operator
  - name
  - notes
* - `+`
  - addition
  -
* - `-`
  - subtraction
  - Also, a unary minus
* - `*`
  - multiplication
  -
* - `/`
  - division
  - Division by `0` is not allowed, and will throw a runtime error if it occurs.
* - `%`
  - modulo
  - This operator can apply to both integer and decimal numbers, and it returns
    the remainder of integer division of two numbers. The right-hand side of
    `%` cannot be zero or a negative number, otherwise a runtime error will be
    thrown. The result of `x % y` is always a number in the range `[0; y)`,
    regardless of the sign of `x`.
* - `+`
  - concatenation
  - When applied to strings, the `+` operator simply glues them together. For
    example, `"Hello" + "World"` produces string `"HelloWorld"`.
```

### Logical

The **logical** operators apply to boolean values. These operators can be written either in
symbolic or word form -- both forms are equivalent:

```{list-table}
:align: left
:class: first-col-align-center
:header-rows: 1
:widths: 1 2 9

* - operator
  - name
  - notes
* - `!`, `not`
  - logical NOT
  - This is a unary operator that inverts its operand: `!true` is `false`,
    and `!false` is `true`.
* - `&&`, `and`
  - logical AND
  - Returns `true` if both of its arguments are `true`.
* - `||`, `or`
  - logical OR
  - Returns `true` if at least one of its arguments is `true`.
* - `^`, `xor`
  - logical XOR
  - Returns `true` if the arguments are different, and `false` if they are
    the same.
```

### Assignment

The **assignment** operators modify the value of a variable. The left-hand side of such an operator
is the variable that shall be modified, the right-hand side is the expression of the same type as
the variable on the left:

```{list-table}
:align: left
:class: first-col-align-center
:header-rows: 1
:widths: 1 2 9

* - operator
  - name
  - notes
* - `=`, `to`
  - assign
  - `$var = X` stores the value of `X` into the variable `$var`
* - `+=`
  - increase
  - `$var += X` is equivalent to `$var = $var + X`
* - `-=`
  - decrease
  - `$var -= X` is equivalent to `$var = $var - X`
* - `*=`
  - multiply
  - `$var *= X` is equivalent to `$var = $var * X`
* - `/=`
  - divide
  - `$var /= X` is equivalent to `$var = $var / X`
* - `%=`
  - reduce modulo
  - `$var %= X` is equivalent to `$var = $var % X`
```

Unlike all other operators, the assignment operators do not produce a value. This means they
cannot be used inside a larger expression, for example the following is invalid: `3 + ($x += 7)`.
Instead, the assignment operators are only usable at the top level of commands such as
[\<\<set\>\>], [\<\<declare\>\>], and [\<\<local\>\>].

### Relational

The **relational** operators compare various values. The first two operators in this list can be
applied to operands of any types, as long as the types are the same. The remaining four operators
can only be used with numbers. Regardless of the types of operands, the result of every
relational operator is a boolean value, which can be either assigned to a variable, or used in a
larger expression:

```{list-table}
:align: left
:class: first-col-align-center
:header-rows: 1
:widths: 1 3 8

* - operator
  - name
  - notes
* - `==`
  - equality
  -
* - `!=`
  - inequality
  -
* - `<`
  - less than
  -
* - `<=`
  - less than or equal
  -
* - `>`
  - greater than
  -
* - `>=`
  - greater than or equal
  -
```

Note that operator chaining is not supported. Thus, for example, `$x == $y == $z` will first
compare variables `$x` and `$y`, then the result of that comparison, which is either `true` or
`false`, will be compared with variable `$z`. Given that such expressions would be highly
confusing to a reader, we recommend against using them. If you need to compare that all three
values `$x`, `$y` and `$z` are the same, then you should use the `&&` operator instead:
`$x == $y && $x == $z`.

## Precedence

Just as in mathematics, the operators have precedence ordering among them, meaning that some
operators will always evaluate before the others. For example, if you write `3 + 4 * 5`, then
the result will be `23` instead of `35` because multiplication has higher precedence than addition
and thus evaluates first.

The precedence order is as follows, from highest to lowest:

- `*`, `/`, `%`;
- `-`, `+`;
- `==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`, `>`;
- `!`;
- `&&`, `^`;
- `||`;
- `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`.

You can use parentheses `()` in order to alter the order of evaluation. For example, `(3 + 4) * 5`
is `35` instead of `23`.

# Variables

A **variable** is a place to store some piece of information -- it is the same notion as in any
other programming language. Each variable has a **name**, **value**, **type**, and a **scope**.

## Name

The **name** of a variable is how you refer to it in a `.yarn` script. The names of all variables
start with a `$` sign, followed by a letter or an underscore, and then by any number of letters,
digits, or underscores. Thus, the following are all valid variables names:

```text
$i
$WARNING
$_secret_
$door10
$climbed_over_wall_and_avoided_all_guard_patrols
$DoorPassword
```

while the following are NOT valid names:

```text
$2000_years
$[main]
@today
victory
```

## Type

Each variable has a certain **type** associated with it. The type of a variable is determined when
the variable is first declared, and it never changes afterwards.

There are three types of variables in YarnSpinner: `string`, `number`, and `bool`.

- `bool` variables can store either `true` or `false` and nothing else;
- `number` variables may contain either integer or decimal numbers, such as `0`, `42`, `2.5`;
- `string` variables contain arbitrary text, for example `"the most random number is 4"`.

```yarn
// Creates a variable $money of type number, and gives it initial value of 100
<<declare $money = 100>>

// Creates variable $name of type string, the initial value will be ""
<<declare $name as String>>
```

## Value

Each variable stores a single **value**. This value can be replaced with another value at any time,
but the type of the new value must be the same.

Each variable will have an initial value assigned to it when the variable is first created, and
then new values can be assigned with the [\<\<set\>\>][set] command.

```yarn
<<set $money += 10>>  // increases the value of $money by 10
```

## Scope

The **scope** of a variable is where exactly it can be accessed. In YarnSpinner, the variables can
be either global or local.

- The **global** variables are introduced via the [\<\<declare\>\>][declare] command, and once
  created can be accessed anywhere. The names of all global variables are unique.
- The **local** variables are created with the [\<\<local\>\>][local] command, and can only be used
  within the node where they were created. It is possible to have a local variable with the same
  name in different nodes, and they will be considered different variables.

```yarn
<<declare $global_variable = 0>>

title: MyNode
---
<<local $local_variable = 1>>

# Functions

A **function** in YarnSpinner is the same notion as in any other programming language, or in math:
it takes a certain number of arguments, and then computes and returns the result. A function call
is indicated by the name of the function, followed by its arguments in parentheses. The parentheses
are required, even when there are no arguments:

```yarn
<<set $roll_2d6 = dice(6) + dice(6)>>
<<set $random = random()>>
```

There are around 20 built-in functions in Jenny, listed below; and it is also possible to add
user-defined functions as well.

## Built-in functions

- **Random functions**
  - [`dice(n)`](random.md#dicen)
  - [`random()`](random.md#random)
  - [`random_range(a, b)`](random.md#random_rangea-b)

- **Numeric functions**
  - [`ceil(x)`](numeric.md#ceilx)
  - [`dec(x)`](numeric.md#decx)
  - [`decimal(x)`](numeric.md#decimalx)
  - [`floor(x)`](numeric.md#floorx)
  - [`inc(x)`](numeric.md#incx)
  - [`int(x)`](numeric.md#intx)
  - [`round(x)`](numeric.md#roundx)
  - [`round_places(x, n)`](numeric.md#round_placesx-n)

- **Type conversion functions**
  - [`bool(x)`](type.md#boolx)
  - [`number(x)`](type.md#numberx)
  - [`string(x)`](type.md#stringx)

- **Other functions**
  - [`if(condition, then, else)`](misc.md#ifcondition-then-else)
  - [`plural(x, ...)`](misc.md#pluralx-words)
  - [`visit_count(node)`](misc.md#visit_countnode)
  - [`visited(node)`](misc.md#visitednode)

## User-defined functions

In addition to the built-in functions, you can also define any number of **user-defined functions**
which can later be used in your yarn scripts. The syntax for these functions is exactly the same
as for the built-in functions: it consists of a function name, followed by the arguments in
parentheses.

Each user-defined function has a fixed signature, declared at the time when the function is added
to the `YarnProject`. A function must have a fixed number of arguments of specific types, and a
fixed return type.

All user-defined functions must be added to the `YarnProject` before they can be used. A compile
error will be raised if the parser encounters an unknown function, or if the number or types of
arguments do not match.

User-defined functions can be used for a variety of purposes, such as:

- implement functionality that is currently missing in Jenny;
- interface with the game engine;
- provide access to "variables" stored outside of Jenny;
- etc.

```yarn
title: Blacksmith
---
// This example showcases several hypothetical user-defined functions:
// - broken(slot): checks whether the item in the given slot is broken;
// - name(slot): gives the name for an item in a slot, e.g. "sword" or "bow";
// - money(): returns the current amount of money that the player has.
// At the same time, functions `round()` and `plural()` are built-in.

<<if broken("main_hand")>>
  <<local $repair_cost = round(value("main_hand") / 5)>>

  Blacksmith: Your {name("main_hand")} seems to be completely broken!
  Blacksmith: I can fix it for just {plural($repair_cost, "% coin")}
  -> Ok, do it  <<if money() >= $repair_cost>>
  -> I'll be fine...
<<endif>>
===
```

# Miscellaneous functions

## if(condition, then, else)

This function implements the ternary-if condition, it is equivalent to the `?:` operator in Dart.

The function evaluates its `condition` (which must be a boolean), and then returns either the value
of `then` if the condition was `true`, or the value of `else` if the condition was `false`. The
types of arguments `then` and `else` must be the same.

Note: Only one of the `then`/`else` values will be evaluated, depending on the `condition`. This
may be important in cases when evaluating those expressions may produce a side-effect.

```yarn
title: Birth
---
Doctor: Congratulations, you have a { if($gender == "m", "boy", "girl") }!
===
```

## plural(x, words...)

Returns the correct plural form depending on the value of variable `x`.

This function is locale-dependent, and its implementation and signature changes depending on the
`locale` property in the `YarnProject`. In all cases, the first argument `x` must be numeric,
while all other arguments should be strings.

The purpose of this function is to form correct plural phrases, according to the rules of the
current language. For example, suppose you need to say `{$n} items`, where `$n` is a variable. If
you simply plug in the value of the variable like that, you'll end up getting phrases like
"23 items", or "1 items" -- which is not what you want. So instead, the `plural()` function can be
used, which will select the correct plural form of the word "item":

```yarn
I have {plural($n, "% item")}.
```

In English locale (`en`), the function `plural()` takes either 1 or 2 `word`s after the numeral
`$x`. The first word is the singular form, and the second is the plural. The second word can be
omitted if the singular form is simple enough that its plural form can be obtained by adding either
`-s` or `-es`. For example:

```yarn
// Here "foot" is an irregular noun, so its plural form must be specified
// explicitly. At the same time, "inch" is regular, and the function
// plural() will know to add "es" to make its plural form.
The distance is {plural($ft, "% foot", "% feet")} and {plural($in, "% inch")}.
```

In locales other than English, the number of plural words can be anywhere from 1 to 3. Usually,
the first word is the singular form, while others are different plurals -- their meaning would
depend on a particular language. For example, in Ukrainian locale (`uk`) the function `plural()`
requires 3 words: the singular form, the "few" plural form, and the "many" plural form:

<!--- cSpell:ignore мене монета монети монет -->

```yarn
// Assuming locale == 'uk'
У мене є {plural($coins, "% монета", "% монети", "% монет")}.

// Produces phrases like this:
//   У мене є 21 монета
//   У мене є 23 монети
//   У мене є 25 монет
```

Note that in all examples above the words contain the `%` sign. This is used as a placeholder where
the numeral itself should be placed. It is allowed for some (or all) of the `words` to not contain
the `%` sign.

## visit_count(node)

Returns the number of times that the `node` was visited.

A node is considered "visited" if the dialogue enters and then exits that node. The node can be
exited either through the normal dialogue flow, or via the [\<\<stop\>\>] command. However, if a
runtime exception occurs while running the node, then the visit will not count.

The `node` argument must be a string, and it must contain a valid node name. If a node with the
given name does not exist in the project, an exception will be thrown.

```yarn
title: LuckyWheel
---
<<if visit_count("LuckyWheel") < 5>>
  Clown: Would you like to spin a wheel and get fabulous prizes?
  -> I sure do!
     <<jump SpinLuckyWheel>>
  -> I don't talk to strangers...
     <<stop>>
<<else>>
  Clown: Sorry kid, we're all out of prizes for now.
<<endif>>
===
```

```{seealso}
- [`visited(node)`](#visitednode)
```

## visited(node)

Returns `true` if the node with the given title was visited, and `false` otherwise.

For a node to be considered "visited", the dialogue must enter and then exit the node at least
once. For example, within a node "X" the expression `visited("X")` will return `false` during the
first run of this node, and `true` upon all subsequent runs.

The `node` argument must be a string, and it must contain a valid node name. If a node with the
given name does not exist in the project, an exception will be thrown.

```yarn
title: MerchantDialogue
---
<<if not visited("MerchantDialogue")>>
  // This part of the dialogue will run only during the first interaction
  // with the merchant.
  Merchant: Greetings! My name is Linn.
  Merchant: I offer exquisite wares for the most fastidious customers!
  Player: Hi. I'm Bob. I like stuff.

# Numeric functions

These functions are used to manipulate numeric values. Most of them take a single numeric argument
and produce a numeric result.

## `ceil(x)`

Returns the value `x` rounded up towards positive infinity. In other words, this returns the
smallest integer value greater than or equal to `x`.

```yarn
title: ceil
---
{ ceil(0)     }  // 0
{ ceil(0.3)   }  // 1
{ ceil(5)     }  // 5
{ ceil(5.001) }  // 6
{ ceil(5.999) }  // 6
{ ceil(-2.07) }  // -2
===
```

```{seealso}
- [`floor(x)`](#floorx)
- [`int(x)`](#intx)
```

## `dec(x)`

Returns the value `x` reduced towards the previous integer. Thus, if `x` is already an integer
this returns `x - 1`, but if `x` is not an integer then this returns `floor(x)`.

```yarn
title: dec
---
{ dec(0)     }  // -1
{ dec(0.3)   }  // 0
{ dec(5.0)   }  // 4
{ dec(5.001) }  // 5
{ dec(5.999) }  // 5
{ dec(-2.07) }  // -3
===
```

```{seealso}
- [`inc(x)`](#incx)
```

## `decimal(x)`

Returns a fractional part of `x`.

If `x` is positive, then the returned value will be between `0` (inclusive) and `1` (exclusive).
If `x` is negative, then the returned value will be between `0` and `-1`. In all cases it should
hold that `x == int(x) + decimal(x)`.

```yarn
title: decimal
---
{ decimal(0)     }  // 0
{ decimal(0.3)   }  // 0.3
{ decimal(5.0)   }  // 0
{ decimal(5.001) }  // 0.001
{ decimal(5.999) }  // 0.999
{ decimal(-2.07) }  // -0.07
===
```

```{seealso}
- [`int(x)`](#intx)
```

## `floor(x)`

Returns the value `x` rounded down towards negative infinity. In other words, this returns the
largest integer value less than or equal to `x`.

```yarn
title: floor
---
{ floor(0)     }  // 0
{ floor(0.3)   }  // 0
{ floor(5)     }  // 5
{ floor(5.001) }  // 5
{ floor(5.999) }  // 5
{ floor(-2.07) }  // -3
===
```

```{seealso}
- [`ceil(x)`](#ceilx)
- [`int(x)`](#intx)
```

## `inc(x)`

Returns the value `x` increased towards the next integer. Thus, if `x` is already an integer
this returns `x + 1`, but if `x` is not an integer then this returns `ceil(x)`.

```yarn
title: inc
---
{ inc(0)     }  // 1
{ inc(0.3)   }  // 1
{ inc(5.0)   }  // 6
{ inc(5.001) }  // 6
{ inc(5.999) }  // 6
{ inc(-2.07) }  // -2
===
```

```{seealso}
- [`dec(x)`](#decx)
```

## `int(x)`

Truncates the fractional part of `x`, rounding it towards zero, and returns just the integer part
of the argument `x`.

```yarn
title: int
---
{ int(0)     }  // 0
{ int(0.3)   }  // 0
{ int(5.0)   }  // 5
{ int(5.001) }  // 5
{ int(5.999) }  // 5
{ int(-2.07) }  // -2
===
```

```{seealso}
- [`decimal(x)`](#decimalx)
- [`round(x)`](#roundx)
```

## `round(x)`

Rounds the value `x` towards a nearest integer.

The values that end with `.5` are rounded up if `x` is positive, and down if `x` is negative.

```yarn
title: round
---
{ round(0)     }  // 0
{ round(0.3)   }  // 0
{ round(5.0)   }  // 5
{ round(5.001) }  // 5
{ round(5.5)   }  // 6
{ round(5.999) }  // 6
{ round(-2.07) }  // -2
{ round(-2.5) }   // -3
===
```

```{seealso}
- [`round_places(x, n)`](#round_placesx-n)
```

## `round_places(x, n)`

Rounds the value `x` to `n` decimal places.

The value `x` can be either positive, negative, or zero, but it must be an integer. Rounding to
`0` decimal places is equivalent to the regular `round(x)` function. If `n` is positive, then the
function will attempt to keep that many digits after the decimal point in `x`. If `n` is negative,
then `round_places()` will round `x` to nearest tens, hundreds, thousands, etc:

```yarn
title: round_places
---
{ round_places(0, 1)     }  // 0
{ round_places(0.3, 1)   }  // 0.3
{ round_places(5.001, 1) }  // 5.0
{ round_places(5.001, 2) }  // 5.0
{ round_places(5.001, 3) }  // 5.001
{ round_places(5.5, 1)   }  // 5.5
{ round_places(5.999, 1) }  // 6.0
{ round_places(-2.07, 1) }  // -2.1
{ round_places(13, -1)   }  // 10
{ round_places(252, -2)  }  // 200
===
```

# Random functions

These functions produce random results each time they run.

Internally, each function uses `YarnSpinner.random` random generator, which can be replaced with a
custom generator if you need reproducible draws for debug purposes, or to prevent the player from
getting different results upon reload.

## `dice(n)`

Returns a random integer between `1` and `n`, inclusive. For example, `dice(6)` will return a
random integer from 1 to 6, as if throwing a regular six-sided die.

The argument `n` must be numeric, and greater or equal than 1. If `n` is a non-integer, then it
will be truncated to an integer value at runtime. Thus, `dice(3.5)` is equivalent to `dice(3)`.

```yarn
<<set $roll = dice(6)>>
<<set $coin_flip = if(dice(2) == 1, "H", "T")>>
```

## `random()`

Returns a random floating-point between `0` and `1`.

This function can be used to implement events with a prescribed probability. For example:

```yarn
<<if random() < 0.001>>
  // This happens only with 0.1% probability
  You found it! The Holy Grail!
<<endif>>
```

## `random_range(a, b)`

Returns a random integer between `a` and `b` inclusive.

Both arguments `a` and `b` must be numeric, and they will be truncated to integers upon evaluation.
The value of `a` must be less than or equal to `b`, or otherwise a runtime exception will be thrown.

The purpose of this function is similar to `dice()`, but it can be used in situations where a
custom range is desired.

```yarn
<<set $coin_flip = bool(random_range(0, 1))>>
```

# Type conversion functions

These functions convert values of one type into another type, if possible. All of these functions
take a single argument of arbitrary type, and return the result of the type corresponding to the
name of the function.

## `bool(x)`

Converts its argument into a boolean value.

- If `x` is already a boolean, then it returns the argument as-is.
- If `x` is numeric, then the result is `false` when `x` is `0`, and `true` for all other values
  of `x`.
- If `x` is string, then the function will check whether that string can be found within
  `YarnProject.trueValues` or `YarnProject.falseValues` sets. If yes, then it will return the
  `true` / `false` value respectively. Otherwise, an error will be thrown.

## `number(x)`

Converts its argument `x` into a numeric value.

- If `x` is boolean, then it returns `1` for `true` and `0` for `false`.
- If `x` is numeric, then it is returned unmodified.
- If `x` is string, then the function attempts to parse that string as a number. A runtime
  exception will be raised if `x` does not have a valid format for a number. The following formats
  are recognized:
  - integer: `"-3"`, `"214"`
  - decimal: `"0.745"`, `"3.14159"`, `".1"`, `"-3."`
  - scientific: `"2e5"`, `"3.11e-05"`
  - hexadecimal: `"0xDEAD"`, `"0x7F"`

## `string(x)`

Converts its argument `x` into a string value.

- If `x` is boolean, returns strings `"true"` or `"false"`.
- If `x` is numeric, converts it into a string representation using the standard Dart's
  `.toString()` method, which attempts to produce the shortest string that can represent
  the number `x`. In particular,
  - if `x` is integer-valued, returns its decimal representation without a decimal point;
  - if `x` is a double in the range `1e-6` to `1e21`, returns its decimal representation
    with a decimal point;
  - for all other doubles, returns `x` written in the scientific (exponential) format.
- If `x` is a string, then it is returned as-is.

scene.

Remove all characters with `clear`.

```dart
yarnProject.characters.clear();

# CommandStorage

The **CommandStorage** is a part of [YarnProject] responsible for storing all [user-defined
commands]. You can access it as the `YarnProject.commands` property.

The command storage can be used to register any number of custom commands, making them available to
use in yarn scripts. Such commands must be registered before parsing the yarn scripts, or the
compiler will throw an error that the command is not recognized.

In order to register a function as a yarn command, the function must satisfy several requirements:

- The function's return value must be `void` or `Future<void>`. If the function returns a future,
  then that future will be awaited before proceeding to the next step of the dialogue. This makes it
  possible to create commands that take a certain time to unfold in the game, for example
  `<<walk>>`, `<<moveCamera>>`, or `<<prompt>>`.
- The function's arguments must be of types that are known to Yarn: `String`, `num`, `int`,
  `double`, or `bool`. All arguments must be positional, non-nullable and can't have any defaults.
- In order to register the function, use methods `addCommand0()` ... `addCommand5()`, according to
  the number of function's arguments.
- If the function's signature has 1 or more booleans at the end, then those arguments will be
  considered optional and will default to `false`.

## Methods

**hasCommand**(`String name`) → `bool`
: Returns the status of whether the command `name` has been added to the storage.

**addCommand0**(`String name`, `FutureOr<void> Function() fn`)
: Registers a no-argument function `fn` as the command `name`.

**addCommand1**(`String name`, `FutureOr<void> Function(T1) fn`)
: Registers a single-argument function `fn` as the command `name`.

**addCommand2**(`String name`, `FutureOr<void> Function(T1, T2) fn`)
: Registers a two-argument function `fn` as the command `name`.

**addCommand3**(`String name`, `FutureOr<void> Function(T1, T2, T3) fn`)
: Registers a three-argument function `fn` as the command `name`.

**addCommand4**(`String name`, `FutureOr<void> Function(T1, T2, T3, T4) fn`)
: Registers a four-argument function `fn` as the command `name`.

**addCommand5**(`String name`, `FutureOr<void> Function(T1, T2, T3, T4, T5) fn`)
: Registers a five-argument function `fn` as the command `name`.

**addOrphanedCommand**(`name`)
: Registers a command `name` which is not backed by any Dart function. Such command will still be
delivered to [DialogueView]s via the `onCommand()` callback, but its arguments will not be parsed.

**clear**
: Removes all user-defined commands

**remove**(`String name`)
: Removes the user-defined command with the specified `name`.

## Properties

**length** → `int`
: The number of user-defined commands registered so far.

**isEmpty** → `bool`
: Returns `true` if no user-defined commands were registered.

**isNotEmpty** → `bool`
: Returns `true` if any commands have been registered

## Examples

### `<<StartQuest>>`

Suppose we want to have a yarn command `<<StartQuest>>`, which would initiate a quest. The command
would take the quest name and quest ID as arguments. Technically, just the ID should be enough --
but then it would be really difficult to read the yarn script and understand what quest is being
initiated. So, instead we'll pass both the ID and the name, and then check at runtime that the ID
of the quest matches its name.

A typical invocation of this command might look like this (note that the name of the quest is in
quotes, otherwise it would be parsed as four different arguments `"Get"`, `"rid"`, `"of"`, and
`"bandits"`):

```yarn
<<StartQuest Q037 "Get rid of bandits">>
```

In order to implement this command, we create a Dart function `startQuest()` with two string
arguments. The function will do a brief animated "Started quest X" message, but we don't want the
game dialogue to wait for that message, so we'll make the function return `void`, not a future.
Finally, we register the command with `commands.addCommand2()`.

```dart
class MyGame {
  late YarnProject yarnProject;

  void startQuest(String questId, String questName) {
    assert(quests.containsKey(questId));
    assert(quests[questId]!.name == questName);
    // ...
  }
  @override
  void onLoad() {
    yarnProject = YarnProject()
      ..commands.addCommand2('StartQuest', startQuest);
  }
}
```

Note that the name of the Dart function is different from the name of the command -- you can choose
whatever names suit your programming style best.

### `<<prompt>>`

The `<<prompt>>` function will open a modal dialogue and ask the user to enter their response. This
command will be waiting for the user's input, so it must return a future. Also, we want to return
the result of the prompt into the dialogue -- but, unfortunately, the commands are not expressions,
and are not supposed to return values. So instead we will write the result into a global variable
`$prompt`, and then the dialogue can access that variable in order to read the result of the prompt.

```dart
class MyGame {
  final YarnProject yarnProject = YarnProject();

  Future<void> prompt(String message) async {
    // This will wait until the modal dialog is popped from the router stack
    final name = await router.pushAndWait(KeyboardDialog(message));
    yarnProject.variables.setVariable(r'$prompt', name);
  }

  @override
  void onLoad() {
    yarnProject
      ..variables.setVariable(r'$prompt', '')
      ..commands.addCommand1('prompt', prompt);
  }
}
```

Then in a yarn script this command can be used like this:

```yarn
<<declare $name as String>>

title: Greeting
---
Guide: Hello, my name is Jenny, and you?
<<prompt "Enter your name:">>
<<set $player = $prompt>>  // Store the name for later
Guide: Nice to meet you, {$player}
===
```

### `<<give>>`

Suppose that we want to make a command that will give the player a certain item, or a number of
items. This command would take 3 arguments: the person who gives the items, the name of the item,
and the quantity. For example:

```yarn
<<give {$quest_reward} TraderJoe>>
```

Note that the quest reward variable will contain both the reward item and its amount, for example
it could be `"100 gold"`, `"5 potion_of_healing"`, or `'1 "Sword of Darkness"'`. When such
variable is substituted into the command at runtime, the command becomes equivalent to

```yarn
<<give 100 gold TraderJoe>>
<<give 5 potion_of_healing TraderJoe>>
<<give 1 "Sword of Darkness" TraderJoe>>
```

which will then be parsed as a regular 3-argument command corresponding to the following Dart
function:

```dart
/// Takes [amount] of [item]s from [source] and gives them to the player.
void give(int amount, String item, String source) {
  // ...
}
```

# DialogueRunner

```{dartdoc}
:file: src/dialogue_runner.dart
:symbol: DialogueRunner
:package: jenny
```

## Execution model

The `DialogueRunner` uses futures as a main mechanism for controlling the timing of the dialogue
progression. For each event, the dialogue runner will invoke the corresponding callback on all its
[DialogueView]s, and each of those callbacks may return a future. The dialogue runner then awaits
on all of these futures (in parallel), before proceeding to the next event.

For a simple `.yarn` script like this

```yarn
title: main
---
Hello
-> Hi
-> Go away
   <<jump Away>>
===

title: Away
---
<<OhNo>>
===
```

the sequence of emitted events will be as follows (assuming the second option is selected):

- `onDialogueStart()`
- `onNodeStart(Node("main"))`
- `onLineStart(Line("Hello"))`
- `onLineFinish(Line("Hello"))`
- `onChoiceStart(Choice(["Hi", "Go away"]))`
- `onChoiceFinish(Option("Go away"))`
- `onNodeFinish(Node("main"))`
- `onNodeStart(Node("Away"))`
- `onCommand(Command("OhNo"))`
- `onNodeFinish(Node("Away"))`
- `onDialogueFinish()`

:::{note}
Keep in mind that if a `DialogueError` is thrown while running the dialogue, then the dialogue will
terminate immediately and none of the `*Finish` callbacks will run.

# FunctionStorage

The **FunctionStorage** is a part of [YarnProject] responsible for storing all [user-defined
functions]. You can access it as the `YarnProject.functions` property.

The function storage can be used to register any number of custom functions, making them
available to use in yarn scripts. Such functions must be registered before parsing the yarn
scripts, or the compiler will throw an error that the function name is not recognized.

A Dart function can be registered as a user-defined function in Jenny, if it satisfies the
following requirements:

- its return type is one of `int`, `double`, `num`, `bool`, or `String`;
- all its arguments are positional, i.e. there are no named arguments;
- all its arguments have types `int`, `int?`, `double`, `double?`, `num`, `num?`, `bool`, `bool?`,
  `String`, or `String?`;
- the nullable arguments, if any, must come after the non-nullable ones. These arguments become
  optional in Yarn scripts, and if not provided they will be passed as `null` values;
- the first argument in a function can also be `YarnProject`. If such argument is present, then
  it will be passed automatically. For example, if you have a function `fn(YarnProject, int)`,
  then it can be invoked from the yarn script simply as `fn(1)`.

A Dart function can then be added using one of the methods `addFunction0`, ..., `addFunction4`,
depending on how many arguments the function has (this is a limitation of Dart's template language).
When registering a function, you give it a `name`, under this function will be known in Yarn
scripts. This name can be the same, or different from the real function's name. For example, you
may have a function `hasVisitedTheWizard()` in your game, but you'd register it under the name
`has_visited_the_wizard()` in your YarnProject.

Keep in mind that the name of the user-defined function must be:

- unique;
- a valid ID;
- cannot be the same as any built-in function.

## Methods

**hasFunction**(`String name`) → `bool`
: Returns the status of whether the function `name` has been already registered.

**addFunction0**(`String name`, `T0 Function() fn`)
: Registers a no-argument function `fn` as the user-defined function `name`.

**addFunction1**(`String name`, `T0 Function(T1) fn1`)
: Registers a single-argument function `fn1` under the name `name`.

**addFunction2**(`String name`, `T0 Function(T1, T2) fn2`)
: Registers a two-argument function `fn2` with the given `name`.

**addFunction3**(`String name`, `T0 Function(T1, T2, T3) fn3`)
: Registers a three-argument function `fn3` with the name `name`.

**addFunction4**(`String name`, `T0 Function(T1, T2, T3, T4) fn4`)
: Registers a four-argument function `fn4` as `name`.

**clear**
: Removes all user-defined functions

**remove**(`String name`)
: Removes the user-defined function with the specified `name`.

## Properties

**length** → `int`
: The number of user-defined functions registered so far.

**isEmpty** → `bool`
: Returns `true` if no user-defined functions were registered.

**isNotEmpty** → `bool`
: Has any functions been registered at all?

# MarkupAttribute

A **MarkupAttribute** is a descriptor of a subrange of text in a [line], demarcated with markup
tags. For example, in a `.yarn` line below there are two ranges of text surrounded by markup tags,
and therefore there will be two `MarkupAttribute`s associated with this line:

```yarn
[b]Jenny[/b] is a library based on \
    [link url="docs.yarnspinner.dev"]YarnSpinner[/link] for Unity.
```

These `MarkupAttribute`s can be found in the `.attributes` property of a [DialogueLine][line].

## Properties

**name** `String`
: The name of the markup tag. In the example above, the name of the first attribute is `"b"`, and
the second is `"link"`.

**start**, **end** `int`
: The location of the marked-up span within the final text of the line. The first index is
inclusive, while the second is exclusive. The `start` may be equal to `end` for a zero-width
markup attribute.

**length** `int`
: The length of marked-up text. This is always equal to `end - start`.

**parameters** `Map<String, dynamic>`
: The set of parameters associated with this markup attribute. In the example above, the first
markup attribute has no parameters, so this map will be empty. The second markup attribute has a
single parameter, so this map will be equal to `{"url": "docs.yarnspinner.dev"}`.

The type of each parameter will be either `String`, `num`, or `bool`, depending on the type of
expression give in the `.yarn` script. The expressions for parameter values can be dynamic, that
is they can be evaluated at runtime. In the example below, the parameter `color` will be equal to
the value of the variable `$color`, which may change each time the line is run.

```yarn
My [i]favorite[/i] color is [bb color=$color]{$color}[/bb].
```

# Node

The **Node** class represents a single [node] within the `.yarn` script. The objects of this class
will be delivered to your [DialogueView]s with the methods `onNodeStart()`, `onNodeFinish()`.

## Properties

**title** `String`
: The title (name) of the node.

**tags** `Map<String, String>`
: Additional tags specified in the header of the node. The map will be empty if there were no tags
besides the required `title` tag.

**iterator** `Iterator<DialogueEntry>`
: The content of the node, which is a sequence of `DialogueLine`s, `DialogueChoice`s, or
`Command`s.

## File: other_modules/jenny/runtime/user_defined_command.md

---

# UserDefinedCommand

The **UserDefinedCommand** class represents a single invocation of a custom (non-built-in) command
within a yarn script. Objects of this type will be delivered to a [DialogueView] in its
`.onCommand()` method.

## Properties

**name** `String`
: The name of the command, without the angle brackets. For example, if the command is `<<smile>>`
in the yarn script, then its name will be `"smile"`.

**argumentString** `String`
: Command arguments, as a single string. For example, if the command is `<<move Hippo {$delta}>>`,
and the value of variable `$delta` is `3.17`, then the argument string will be `"Hippo 3.17"`.

The `argumentString` is re-evaluated every time the command is executed, however, it is an error
to access this property before the command was executed by the dialogue runner.

**arguments** `List<dynamic>?`
: Command arguments, as a list of parsed values. This property will be null if the command was
declared without a signature (i.e. as an "orphaned command"). However, if the command was linked
as an external function, then the number and types of arguments in the list will correspond to
the arguments of that function.

In the same example as above, the `arguments` will be `['Hippo', 3.17]`, assuming the linked Dart
function is `move(String target, double distance)`.

# VariableStorage

```{dartdoc}
:package: jenny
:symbol: VariableStorage
:file: src/variable_storage.dart
```

## Accessing variable storage

Variable storage is accessed via the [YarnProject].

```dart
final variables = yarnProject.variables;
```

## Removing variables

In most cases variables should be retained for the life of the [YarnProject]. However there may be
situations where variables need to be removed from storage. For example, in a game with many
scenes, variables specific to that scene could be removed if they are no longer required.

Remove all variables with `clear`. By default this will retain node visit counts, which are also
stored as variables. Node visit counts are used by Yarn for logic such as 'do this if the node has
already been visited', so it's best to leave these alone. However, to remove them as well set
`clearNodeVisits` to `true`.

```dart
/// Clear all variables except node visit counts.
yarnProject.variables.clear();

/// Clear all variables including node visit counts.
yarnProject.variables.clear(clearNodeVisits: true);
```

Use `remove` to remove a single variable.

```dart
yarnProject.variables.remove('money');
```

# Yarn Project

A **YarnProject** is the central hub for all yarn scripts and the accompanying information.
Generally, there would be a single `YarnProject` in a game, though it is also possible to make
several yarn projects if their content is completely independent.

The standard sequence of initializing a `YarnProject` is the following:

- link user-defined functions;
- link user-defined commands;
- set the locale (if different from `en`);
- parse a `.yarn` script containing declarations of global variables and characters;
- parse all other `.yarn` scripts;
- restore the variables from a save-game storage.

For example:

```dart
final yarn = YarnProject()
  ..functions.addFunction0('money', player.getMoney)
  ..commands.addCommand1('achievement', player.earnAchievement)
  ..parse(readFile('project.yarn'))
  ..parse(readFile('chapter1.yarn'))
  ..parse(readFile('chapter2.yarn'));
```

## Properties

**locale** `String`
: The language used in this `YarnProject` (the default is `'en'`). Selecting a different language
changes the builtin `plural()` function.

**random** `Random`
: The random number generator. This can be replaced with a different generator, if, for example,
you need to control the seed.

**nodes** `Map<String, Node>`
: All [Node]s loaded into the project, keyed by their titles.

**variables** `VariableStorage`
: The container for all global variables used in this yarn project. There could be several reasons
to access this storage:

  <!-- markdownlint-disable MD006 MD007 -->

- to change the value of a yarn variable from the game. This enables you to pass the information
  from the game into the dialogue. For example, your dialogue may have variable `$gold`, which
  you may want to update whenever the player's amount of money changes within the game.
- to store the values of all yarn variables during the save game, and to restore them when
loading the game.
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD006 MD007 -->

**functions** `FunctionStorage`
: The [container][FunctionStorage] for all user-defined functions linked into the project. The main
reason to access this property is to register new custom function to be available at runtime.

Note that all custom functions must be added to the `YarnProject` before they can be used in a
dialogue script -- otherwise a compile error will occur when encountering an unknown function.

**commands** `CommandStorage`
: The [container][CommandStorage] for all user-defined commands linked into the project. The main
reason to access this container is to register new custom commands.

All custom commands must be added before they can be used in the dialogue script.

**characters** `CharacterStorage`
: The [container][CharacterStorage] for all [Character] objects declared in your yarn scripts.

**strictCharacterNames** `bool`
: If `true` (default), the validity of character names will be strictly enforced. That is, all
characters must be declared before they can be used, using the [\<\<character\>\>] commands. If
this property is set to false, then new [Character] objects will be created automatically as
they are encountered in scripts.

**trueValues**, **falseValues** `Set<String>`
: The strings that can be recognized as `true`/`false` values respectively.

**variables** `VariableStorage`
: The [container][VariableStorage] for all variables declared and manipulated in your yarn scripts.
This is also used for maintaining the visit counts for nodes that the user has visited. To
implement a 'save game' feature it is possible to save the variables from
`VariableStorage.variables` and later restore them again.

## Methods

**parse**(`String text`)
: Parses and compiles the `text` of a yarn script. After this command, the nodes contained within
the script will be runnable.

This method can be executed multiple times, and each time the new nodes will be added to the
existing ones.

# Components

Components in Oxygen are different than the ones from FCS mainly because instead of containing logic
they only contain data. This data is then used in systems which in turn define the logic. To
accommodate people who are switching from FCS to Oxygen we implemented a few components to help you
get started. Some of these components are based on the multiple functionalities that the
`PositionComponent` from FCS has. Others are just easy wrappers around certain Flame API
functionality, they are often accompanied by predefined systems that you can use.

Components can be registered to the world using the `world.registerComponent` method on
`OxygenGame`.

## PositionComponent

The `PositionComponent` as its name implies is a component that describes the position of an
entity. And it is registered to the world by default.

Creating a positioned entity using OxygenGame:

```dart
game.createEntity(
  position: Vector2(100, 100),
  size: // ...
);
```

Creating a positioned entity using the World:

```dart
world.createEntity()
  ..add<PositionComponent, Vector2>(Vector2(100, 100));
```

## SizeComponent

The `SizeComponent` as its name implies is a component that describes the size of an entity.
And it is registered to the world by default.

Creating a sized entity using OxygenGame:

```dart
game.createEntity(
  position: // ...
  size: Vector2(50, 50),
);
```

Creating a sized entity using the World:

```dart
world.createEntity()
  ..add<SizeComponent, Vector2>(Vector2(50, 50));
```

## AnchorComponent

The `AnchorComponent` as its name implies is a component that describes the anchor position of an
entity. And it is registered to the world by default.

This component is especially useful when you are using the `BaseSystem`. But can also
be used for your anchoring logic.

Creating an anchored entity using OxygenGame:

```dart
game.createEntity(
  position: // ...
  size: // ...
  anchor: Anchor.center,
);
```

Creating an anchored entity using the World:

```dart
world.createEntity()
  ..add<AnchorComponent, Anchor>(Anchor.center);
```

### AngleComponent

The `AngleComponent` as its name implies is a component that describes the angle of an entity and
it is registered to the world by default. The angle is in radians.

This component is especially useful when you are using the `BaseSystem`. But can also
be used for your angle logic.

Creating an angled entity using OxygenGame:

```dart
game.createEntity(
  position: // ...
  size: // ...
  angle: 1.570796,
);
```

Creating an angled entity using the World:

```dart
world.createEntity()
  ..add<AngleComponent, double>(1.570796);
```

## FlipComponent

The `FlipComponent` can be used to flip your rendering on either the X or Y axis. It is registered
to the world by default.

This component is especially useful when you are using the `BaseSystem`. But can also
be used for your flipping logic.

Creating an entity that is flipped on its X-axis using OxygenGame:

```dart
game.createEntity(
  position: // ...
  size: // ...
  flipX: true
);
```

Creating an entity that is flipped on its X-axis using the World:

```dart
world.createEntity()
  ..add<FlipComponent, FlipInit>(FlipInit(flipX: true));
```

## SpriteComponent

The `SpriteComponent` as its name implies is a component that describes the sprite of an entity and
it is registered to the world by default.

This allows you to assign a Sprite to an Entity.

Creating an entity with a sprite using OxygenGame:

```dart
game.createEntity(
  position: // ...
  size: // ...
)..add<SpriteComponent, SpriteInit>(
  SpriteInit(await game.loadSprite('pizza.png')),
);
```

Creating an entity with a sprite using World:

```dart
world.createEntity()
  ..add<SpriteComponent, SpriteInit>(
    SpriteInit(await game.loadSprite('pizza.png')),
  );
```

## TextComponent

The `TextComponent` as its name implies is a component that adds a text component to an entity.
And it is registered to the world by default.

This allows you to add text to your entity, combined with the `PositionComponent` you can use it
as a text entity.

Creating an entity with text using OxygenGame:

```dart
game.createEntity(
  position: // ...
  size: // ...
)..add<TextComponent, TextInit>(
  TextInit(
    'Your text',
    config: const TextPaintConfig(),
  ),
);
```

Creating an entity with text using World:

```dart
world.createEntity()
  ..add<TextComponent, TextInit>(
    TextInit(
      'Your text',
      config: const TextPaintConfig(),
    ),
  );
```

## ParticleComponent

The `ParticleComponent` wraps a `Particle` from Flame. Combined with the `ParticleSystem` you can
easily add particles to your game without having to worry about how to render a particle or when/how
to update one.

Creating an entity with a particle using OxygenGame:

```dart
game.createEntity(
  position: // ...
  size: // ...
)..add<ParticleComponent, Particle>(
  // Your Particle.
);
```

Creating an entity with a particle using World:

```dart
world.createEntity()
  ..add<ParticleComponent, Particle>(
    // Your Particle.
  );
```

# Oxygen

We (the Flame organization) built an ECS (Entity Component System) named Oxygen.

If you want to use Oxygen specifically for Flame as a replacement for the
FCS(Flame Component System) you should use our bridge library
[flame_oxygen](https://github.com/flame-engine/flame/tree/main/packages/flame_oxygen) and if you
just want to use it in a Dart project you can use the
[oxygen](https://github.com/flame-engine/oxygen) library directly.

If you are not familiar with Oxygen yet we recommend you read up on its
[documentation](https://github.com/flame-engine/oxygen/tree/main/doc).

To use it in your game you just need to add `flame_oxygen` to your `pubspec.yaml`, as can be seen
in the
[Oxygen example](https://github.com/flame-engine/flame/tree/main/packages/flame_oxygen/example)
and in the `pub.dev` [installation instructions](https://pub.dev/packages/flame_oxygen).

## OxygenGame (Game extension)

If you are going to use Oxygen in your project it can be a good idea to use the Oxygen specific
extension of the `Game` class.

It is called `OxygenGame` and it will give you full access to the Oxygen framework while also
having full access to the Flame game loop.

Instead of using `onLoad`, as you are used to with Flame, `OxygenGame` comes with the `init`
method. This method is called in the `onLoad` but before the world initialization, allowing you
to register components and systems and do anything else that you normally would do in `onLoad`.

A simple `OxygenGame` implementation example can be seen in the
[example folder](https://github.com/flame-engine/flame/tree/main/packages/flame_oxygen/example).

The `OxygenGame` also comes with it's own `createEntity` method that automatically adds certain
default components on the entity. This is especially helpful when you are using the
[BaseSystem](#basesystem) as your base.

## Systems

Systems define the logic of your game. In FCS you normally would add your logic inside a component
with Oxygen we use systems for that. Oxygen itself is completely platform agnostic, meaning it has
no render loop. It only knows `execute`, which is a method equal to the `update` method in Flame.

On each `execute` Oxygen automatically calls all the systems that were registered in order. But in
Flame we can have different logic for different loops (render/update). So in `flame_oxygen` we
introduced the `RenderSystem` and `UpdateSystem` mixin. These mixins allow you to add the `render`
method and the `update` method respectively to your custom system. For more information see the
[RenderSystem](#mixin-rendersystem) and [UpdateSystem](#mixin-updatesystem) section.

If you are coming from FCS you might expect certain default functionality that you normally got
from the `PositionComponent`. As mentioned before components do not contain any kind of logic, but
to give you the same default functionality we also created a class called `BaseSystem`. This system
acts almost identical to the prerender logic from the `PositionComponent` in FCS. You only have
to subclass it to your own system. For more information see the
[BaseSystem](#basesystem) section.

Systems can be registered to the world using the `world.registerSystem` method on
[OxygenGame](#oxygengame-game-extension).

### mixin GameRef

The `GameRef` mixin allows a system to become aware of the `OxygenGame` instance its attached to.
This allows easy access to the methods on the game class.

```dart
class YourSystem extends System with GameRef<YourGame> {
  @override
  void init() {
    // Access to game using the .game property
  }

  // ...
}
```

### mixin RenderSystem

The `RenderSystem` mixin allows a system to be registered for the render loop.
By adding a `render` method to the system you get full access to the canvas as
you normally would in Flame.

```dart
class SimpleRenderSystem extends System with RenderSystem {
  Query? _query;

  @override
  void init() {
    _query = createQuery([/* Your filters */]);
  }

  void render(Canvas canvas) {
    for (final entity in _query?.entities ?? <Entity>[]) {
      // Render entity based on components
    }
  }
}
```

### mixin UpdateSystem

The `MixinSystem` mixin allows a system to be registered for the update loop.
By adding a `update` method to the system you get full access to the delta time as you
normally would in Flame.

```dart
class SimpleUpdateSystem extends System with UpdateSystem {
  Query? _query;

  @override
  void init() {
    _query = createQuery([/* Your filters */]);
  }

  void update(double dt) {
    for (final entity in _query?.entities ?? <Entity>[]) {
      // Update components values
    }
  }
}
```

### BaseSystem

The `BaseSystem` is an abstract class whose logic can be compared to the `PositionComponent`
from FCS. The `BaseSystem` automatically filters all entities that have the `PositionComponent`
and `SizeComponent` from `flame_oxygen`. On top of that you can add your own filters by defining
a getter called `filters`. These filters are then used to filter down the entities you are
interested in.

The `BaseSystem` is also fully aware of the game instance. You can access the game instance by using
the `game` property. This also gives you access to the `createEntity` helper method on `OxygenGame`.

On each render loop the `BaseSystem` will prepare your canvas the same way the `PositionComponent`
from FCS would (translating, rotating and setting the anchor. After that it will call the
`renderEntity` method so you can add your own render logic for that entity on a prepared canvas.

The following components will be checked by `BaseSystem` for the preparation of the canvas:

- `PositionComponent` (required)
- `SizeComponent` (required)
- `AnchorComponent` (optional, defaults to `Anchor.topLeft`)
- `AngleComponent` (optional, defaults to `0`)

```dart
class SimpleBaseSystem extends BaseSystem {
  @override
  List<Filter<Component>> get filters => [];

  @override
  void renderEntity(Canvas canvas, Entity entity) {
    // The canvas is translated, rotated and fully prepared for rendering.
  }
}
```

### ParticleSystem

The `ParticleSystem` is a simple system that brings the Particle API from Flame to Oxygen. This
allows you to use the [ParticleComponent](components.md#particlecomponent) without having to worry
about how it will render or when to update it. As most of that logic is already contained in the
Particle itself.

Simply register the `ParticleSystem` and the `ParticleComponent` to your world like so:

```dart
world.registerSystem(ParticleSystem());

world.registerComponent<ParticleComponent, Particle>(() => ParticleComponent);
```

You can now create a new entity with a `ParticleComponent`. For more info about that see the
`ParticleComponent` section.

# Bare Flame game

This tutorial assumes that you have basic familiarity with using the command line, and the following
programs on your computer (all of them are free):

- [Flutter], version 3.13.0 or above.
- [Android Studio], or any other IDE for example [Visual Studio Code].
- [git] (optional), to save your project on GitHub.

## 1. Check flutter installation

First, let's verify that your Flutter SDK was installed correctly and is accessible from the command
line:

```shell
$ flutter doctor
Doctor summary (to see all details, run flutter doctor -v):
[✓] Flutter (Channel stable, 3.13.7, on macOS 13.6 22G120 darwin-arm64, locale en)
[✓] Android toolchain - develop for Android devices (Android SDK version 33.0.0)
[✓] Xcode - develop for iOS and macOS (Xcode 15.0)
[✓] Chrome - develop for the web
[✓] Android Studio (version 2021.2)
[✓] IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition (version 2022.2.2)
[✓] VS Code (version 1.83.0)
[✓] Connected device (2 available)
[✓] Network resources

• No issues found!
```

Your output will be slightly different, but the important thing is to verify that no errors are
reported and that your Flutter version is at least **3.13.0**.

## 2. Create the Project Directory

Now you need to come up with a name for your project. The name can only use lowercase Latin letters,
digits, and underscores. It must also be a valid Dart identifier (thus, for example, it cannot be a
keyword). In this tutorial, we're going to call the project **syzygy**, which is a totally real
non-made-up word.

Create the directory for your new project:

```shell
mkdir -p ~/projects/syzygy
cd ~/projects/syzygy
```

## 3. Initialize empty Flutter project

To turn this barren directory into an actual Flutter project, run the following command:

```shell
flutter create .
```

(I have omitted the output for brevity, but there will be lots of output).

You can verify that the project files were created successfully:

```shell
$ ls
README.md               android/   lib/           pubspec.yaml   test/
analysis_options.yaml   ios/       pubspec.lock   syzygy.iml     web/
```

## 4. Open the project in Android Studio

Launch Android Studio, then in the project selection window choose `[Open]` and navigate to your
project directory. With any luck, the project will now look like this:

![Project in Android Studio](../images/tutorials/android-studio-screenshot-1.webp)

If you see only the `main.dart` file but not the side panel, then click the vertical `[Project]`
button at the left edge of the window.

Before we proceed, let's fix the view in the left panel. Locate the button in the top left corner
that says `[Android]` in the screenshot. In this dropdown select the first option "Project". Your
project window should now look like this:

![Project in Android Studio](../images/tutorials/android-studio-screenshot-2.webp)

The important part is that you should be able to see all files in your project directory.

## 5. Clean up the project files

The default project created by Flutter is not very useful for making a Flame game, so we should get
rid of it.

First, open the file `pubspec.yaml` and replace it with the following code (adjusting the `name` and
`description` to match your project):

```yaml
name: syzygy
description: Syzygy Flame game
version: 0.0.0
publish_to: none

environment:
  sdk: ^3.0.0
  flutter: ^3.13.0

dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flame: ^--VERSION--
```

After that, press the `[Pub get]` button at the top of the window, or you could run command `flutter
pub get` from the terminal. This will "apply" the changes in `pubspec` file to your project, in
particular, it will download the Flame library which we have declared as a dependency. In the
future, you should run `flutter pub get` whenever you make changes to this file.

Now, open the file `lib/main.dart` and replace its content with the following:

```dart
import 'package:flame/game.dart';
import 'package:flutter/widgets.dart';

void main() {
  final game = FlameGame();
  runApp(GameWidget(game: game));
}
```

Lastly, remove the file `test/widget_test.dart` completely.

## 6. Run the project

Let's verify that everything is working as intended, and the project can run.

In the menu bar at the top of the window find a dropdown that says `<no device selected>`. In that
dropdown choose `<Chrome (web)>` instead.

After that open the `main.dart` file and press the green arrow next to the `void main()` function in
line 4. Select `[Run main.dart]` from the menu.

This should open a new Chrome window (which may take 10-30 seconds) and run your project in that
window. For now, it will simply show a black screen, which is expected because we created the game
in its simplest blank configuration.

## 7. Sync to GitHub

The last step is to upload your project to GitHub. This is not required but strongly recommended as
it will serve as a backup for your code. This step assumes that you already have a GitHub account.

Log into your GitHub account, select `[Your repositories]` from your profile dropdown, and press the
green `[New]` button. In the form, enter the repository name the same as your project name; select
type "private"; and opt out of adding initial files like `README`, `license`, and `.gitignore`.

Now go to your project's directory in the terminal and execute the following commands (make sure to
replace the URL with the link to the repository that you just created):

```shell
git init
git add --all
git commit -m 'Initial commit'
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-github-username/syzygy.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

At this point, if you go to your repository page on GitHub, you shall see that all your project
files are there.

## 8. Done

That's it! By this point you have

- Created an initial blank state Flame project;
- Set up the Android Studio IDE for that project;
- Created a GitHub repository for the project.

Happy coding!

# Basic shader tutorial

This tutorial will give you a brief understanding of how to create and use basic shaders on
`SpriteComponent`s with `PostProcess` and `PostProcessComponent` using Dart/Flutter and the Flame
engine.

This tutorial assumes that you have a working Flame project set up. If you don't, please follow
the [](bare_flame_game.md) tutorial first.

The tutorial consists of 4 steps. We will create a simple outline shader for sprites which have a
transparent background layer.

```{note}
This tutorial is intended to work on images with transparent
background, like `.png` files.

# 1. Sprite Component

## Architecture and Responsibilities

Let's create the component where we render our sprite and apply the shader. We will split this
into two classes:

- a `SpriteComponent` subclass that loads the image and handles input events
- a `PostProcessComponent` subclass that wraps the sprite and applies the shader

This separation means that shader changes only require editing the wrapper class, while sprite
changes like adding input event mixins or additional children only require editing the sprite
class.

## Image resource

For this tutorial we need an image with a transparent background to apply the outline shader to.
Create an `assets/images/` directory in your project and add your `.png` image there.

Don't forget to register the assets folder in `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
flutter:
  assets:
    - assets/images/
```

## Sprite

Create a new file named `sword_component.dart` (replace "sword" with your own image name):

```dart
import 'package:flame/components.dart';

class SwordSprite extends SpriteComponent {
  @override
  Future<void> onLoad() async {
    sprite = await Sprite.load('sword.png');
    size = sprite!.srcSize;
  }
}
```

## Wrapper

Next, add the wrapper class that applies the post process. In the same file, create:

```dart
import 'package:flame/components.dart';
import 'package:flame/post_process.dart';

import 'package:basic_shader_tutorial/outline_postprocess.dart';

class OutlinedSwordSprite extends PostProcessComponent {
  OutlinedSwordSprite({super.position, super.anchor})
    : super(
        children: [SwordSprite()],
        postProcess: OutlinePostProcess(anchor: anchor ?? Anchor.topLeft),
      );
}
```

## Result

The final `sword_component.dart` file looks like this:

```dart
import 'package:flame/components.dart';
import 'package:flame/post_process.dart';

import 'package:basic_shader_tutorial/outline_postprocess.dart';

class OutlinedSwordSprite extends PostProcessComponent {
  OutlinedSwordSprite({super.position, super.anchor})
    : super(
        children: [SwordSprite()],
        postProcess: OutlinePostProcess(anchor: anchor ?? Anchor.topLeft),
      );
}

class SwordSprite extends SpriteComponent {
  @override
  Future<void> onLoad() async {
    sprite = await Sprite.load('sword.png');
    size = sprite!.srcSize;
  }
}
```

This won't compile yet because `OutlinePostProcess` doesn't exist. Let's create it in the next
step!

---

## File: tutorials/basic_shader/step2.md

---

# 2. Outline Post Process

## Responsibility

The `PostProcess` class manages the fragment (pixel) shader. It is responsible for loading the
shader program, creating GPU resources, and keeping uniform variables up to date each frame. You
can also expose runtime settings through uniforms, for example to enable or disable effects.

## Post process

Create a new file named `outline_postprocess.dart`. This class loads the shader program in
`onLoad()` and passes uniform values to the GPU each frame in `postProcess()`:

```dart
import 'dart:ui';

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

import 'package:flame/components.dart';
import 'package:flame/post_process.dart';

extension on Color {
  Vector4 toVector4() {
    return Vector4(r, g, b, a);
  }
}

class OutlinePostProcess extends PostProcess {
  final double outlineSize;
  Color outlineColor;
  final Anchor anchor;

  OutlinePostProcess({
    this.outlineSize = 7.0,
    this.outlineColor = Colors.purpleAccent,
    this.anchor = Anchor.topLeft,
  });

  late final FragmentProgram _fragmentProgram;
  late final FragmentShader _fragmentShader =
      _fragmentProgram.fragmentShader();
  late final Paint _myPaint = Paint()..shader = _fragmentShader;

  @override
  Future<void> onLoad() async {
    await super.onLoad();

    _fragmentProgram =
        await FragmentProgram.fromAsset('assets/shaders/outline.frag');
  }

  @override
  void postProcess(Vector2 size, Canvas canvas) {
    final preRenderedSubtree = rasterizeSubtree();

    _fragmentShader.setFloatUniforms((value) {
      value
        ..setVector(size)
        ..setFloat(outlineSize)
        ..setVector(outlineColor.toVector4());
    });

    _fragmentShader.setImageSampler(0, preRenderedSubtree);

    canvas
      ..save()
      ..translate(-size.x * anchor.x, -size.y * anchor.y)
      ..drawRect(Offset.zero & size.toSize(), _myPaint)
      ..restore();
  }
}
```

With this file in place, the syntax error from the previous step will go away.

Since the `PostProcessComponent` is the parent of the `SpriteComponent`, the post process renders
first and the sprite is drawn on top. The `rasterizeSubtree()` call captures all children into an
image that the shader can sample from.

## Usage

Now we need to wire everything together. Open `main.dart` and add both a plain sprite and an
outlined sprite to the world so we can compare them side by side:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

import 'package:flame/components.dart';
import 'package:flame/game.dart';

import 'package:basic_shader_tutorial/sword_component.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(
    GameWidget(game: MyGame()),
  );
}

class MyGame extends FlameGame {
  MyGame() : super(world: MyWorld());

  @override
  Color backgroundColor() => Colors.green;
}

class MyWorld extends World {
  @override
  Future<void> onLoad() async {
    add(
      SwordSprite()
        ..position = Vector2(-200, 0)
        ..anchor = Anchor.center,
    );

    add(
      OutlinedSwordSprite(
        position: Vector2(200, 0),
        anchor: Anchor.center,
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

Here we use a custom `FlameGame` subclass to override the background color. Adjust the positions
and color to suit your own images.

Run the application. You should see only one sprite, the outlined one is missing. The console
will show why:
`[...] Unhandled Exception: Exception: Asset 'assets/shaders/outline.frag' not found [...]`

We haven't created the shader file yet. Let's do that in the next step.

# 3. Shader

## Considerations

In this section we will create the fragment (pixel) shader program that runs on the GPU.

Keep in mind that shader code requires different thinking from regular Dart code, since the
fragment shader runs once per pixel, every frame.

```{note}
Be mindful of branching and looping in shaders, as operations
scale linearly with pixel count and loop iterations per frame.
```

```{note}
Shader optimization is out of scope for this tutorial. As a
quick example, comparing squared distances instead of using
`sqrt` would be more efficient.
```

## Shader code

Create a new directory at `assets/shaders/` and a file named `outline.frag`:

```glsl
#version 460 core

precision mediump float;

#include <flutter/runtime_effect.glsl>

uniform vec2 uSize;
uniform float uOutlineWidth;
uniform vec4 uOutlineColor;
uniform sampler2D uTexture;

const int MAX_SAMPLE_DISTANCE = 8;

out vec4 fragColor;

void main() {
  vec2 uv = FlutterFragCoord().xy / uSize;
  vec4 texColor = texture(uTexture, uv);

  // If the current pixel is not transparent, render the original color
  if (texColor.a > 0.0) {
    fragColor = texColor;
    return;
  }

  // Check surrounding pixels for outline
  vec2 texelSize = 1.0 / uSize;
  bool foundOpaqueNearby = false;

  // Sample in the bounding square pattern around the current pixel
  // You must use static const loop counts in GLSL
  for (int x = -MAX_SAMPLE_DISTANCE; x <= MAX_SAMPLE_DISTANCE; x++) {
    for (int y = -MAX_SAMPLE_DISTANCE; y <= MAX_SAMPLE_DISTANCE; y++) {
      if (x == 0 && y == 0) continue;

      // Check real distance instead of manhattan distance
      float distance = sqrt(float( x*x + y*y ));
      if (distance > uOutlineWidth) continue;

      // Sample the shifted pixel from the current pixel (uv)
      vec2 offset = vec2(float(x), float(y)) * texelSize;
      vec4 sampleColor = texture(uTexture, uv + offset);

      if (sampleColor.a > 0.0) {
        // We found solid color in the iteration --> sprite is nearby
        foundOpaqueNearby = true;
        break;
      }
    }
    // Break out from outer loop too
    if (foundOpaqueNearby) break;
  }

  if (foundOpaqueNearby) {
    fragColor = uOutlineColor;
  } else {
    fragColor = vec4(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0);
  }
}
```

For each transparent pixel, the shader checks whether any nearby pixel is opaque. If so, it
colors the pixel with the outline color (passed in as a uniform). Otherwise, it stays fully
transparent. This is why transparent `.png` images are required.

```{note}
GLSL loop bounds must be compile-time constants, so the
`uOutlineWidth` uniform cannot be used directly. Make sure
`MAX_SAMPLE_DISTANCE` is at least as large as the outline
width you set in Dart.
```

## Shader resource

Register the shader in `pubspec.yaml` so Flutter bundles it at build time:

```yaml
flutter:
  assets:
    - assets/images/
  shaders:
    - assets/shaders/outline.frag
```

Run the application. You should now see two sprites: one plain and one with a colored outline.

![Image of the reference and the shader](../../images/tutorials/basic_shader/final_result.png)

The basic shader is working. It's time to experiment!

# 4. User Input

In this step we add mouse hover support so the outline color changes when the cursor enters the
sprite.

## Event handling

Open `sword_component.dart` and add the `HoverCallbacks` mixin to `OutlinedSwordSprite`:

```dart
import 'package:flame/events.dart';

class OutlinedSwordSprite extends PostProcessComponent
    with HoverCallbacks {
  // ...
}
```

Then add a field to store the original color, and override the hover callbacks to swap it:

```dart
Color? _originalPostProcessColor;

@override
void onHoverEnter() {
  super.onHoverEnter();

  final outlinePostProcess = postProcess as OutlinePostProcess;
  _originalPostProcessColor = outlinePostProcess.outlineColor;
  outlinePostProcess.outlineColor = Colors.blue;
}

@override
void onHoverExit() {
  final outlinePostProcess = postProcess as OutlinePostProcess;
  outlinePostProcess.outlineColor =
      _originalPostProcessColor ?? Colors.purpleAccent;

  super.onHoverExit();
}
```

## Full solution

The final `sword_component.dart` with hover support:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

import 'package:flame/components.dart';
import 'package:flame/events.dart';
import 'package:flame/post_process.dart';

import 'package:basic_shader_tutorial/outline_postprocess.dart';

class OutlinedSwordSprite extends PostProcessComponent
    with HoverCallbacks {
  OutlinedSwordSprite({super.position, super.anchor})
    : super(
        children: [SwordSprite()],
        postProcess: OutlinePostProcess(anchor: anchor ?? Anchor.topLeft),
      );

  @override
  void onChildrenChanged(
    Component component,
    ChildrenChangeType changeType,
  ) {
    _recalculateBoundingSize();
    super.onChildrenChanged(component, changeType);
  }

  void _recalculateBoundingSize() {
    final boundingBox = Vector2.zero();

    final rectChildren = children.query<PositionComponent>();
    if (rectChildren.isNotEmpty) {
      final boundingRect = rectChildren
          .map((child) => child.toRect())
          .reduce((a, b) => a.expandToInclude(b));

      boundingBox.setValues(boundingRect.width, boundingRect.height);
    }

    size = boundingBox;
  }

  Color? _originalPostProcessColor;

  @override
  void onHoverEnter() {
    super.onHoverEnter();

    final outlinePostProcess = postProcess as OutlinePostProcess;
    _originalPostProcessColor = outlinePostProcess.outlineColor;
    outlinePostProcess.outlineColor = Colors.blue;
  }

  @override
  void onHoverExit() {
    final outlinePostProcess = postProcess as OutlinePostProcess;
    outlinePostProcess.outlineColor =
        _originalPostProcessColor ?? Colors.purpleAccent;

    super.onHoverExit();
  }
}

class SwordSprite extends SpriteComponent {
  @override
  Future<void> onLoad() async {
    sprite = await Sprite.load('sword.png');
    size = sprite!.srcSize;
  }
}
```

When you hover over the sprite, the outline turns blue. When the cursor leaves, it reverts to the
original color.

# Takeaways

## Conclusion

There are three layers involved when using shaders in Flame:

- **Component layer** (`SpriteComponent` and `PostProcessComponent`): connects shaders to Flame
  components, holds game logic and handles user input.
- **Post process layer** (`PostProcess`): bridges components and shaders, manages runtime settings
  and updates uniforms each frame.
- **GLSL shader** (`.frag` file): the GPU program that determines the final pixel colors.

## Closure

We hope this tutorial helped you understand the basics of using shaders in Flame. Feel free to
tweak the code to suit your needs, happy coding!

# Klondike game tutorial

[Klondike] is a popular solitaire card game. In this tutorial we will follow the step-by-step
process for coding this game using the Flame engine.

This tutorial assumes that you have at least some familiarity with common programming concepts, and
with the [Dart] programming language.

## File: tutorials/klondike/step1.md

# 1. Preparation

Before you begin any kind of game project, you need to give it a **name**. For
this tutorial the name will be simply `klondike`.

Having this name in mind, please head over to the [tutorial](../bare_flame_game.md)
and complete the necessary set up steps. When you come back, you should
already have the `main.dart` file with the following content:

```dart
import 'package:flame/game.dart';
import 'package:flutter/widgets.dart';

void main() {
  final game = FlameGame();
  runApp(GameWidget(game: game));
}
```

## Planning

The start of any project usually feels overwhelming. Where even to begin?
I always find it useful to create a rough sketch of what I am about to code,
so that it can serve as a reference point. My sketch for the Klondike game is
shown below:

![Sketch of the klondike card game](../../images/tutorials/klondike-sketch.webp)

Here you can see both the general layout of the game, as well as names of
various objects. These names are the [standard terminology] for solitaire games.
Which is really lucky, because normally figuring out good names for various
classes is quite a challenging task.

Looking at this sketch, we can already imagine the high-level structure of the
game. Obviously, there will be a `Card` class, but also the `Stock` class, the
`Waste` class, a `Tableau` containing seven `Pile`s, and 4 `Foundation`s. There
may also be a `Deck`. All of these components will be tied together via the
`KlondikeGame` derived from the `FlameGame`.

## Assets

Another important aspect in any game development is the game's assets. These
includes images, sprites, animations, sounds, textures, data files, and so on.
In such a simple game as Klondike we won't need lots of fancy graphics, but
still some sprites will be needed in order to draw the cards.

In order to prepare the graphic assets, I first took a physical playing card and
measured it to be 63mm × 88mm, which is the ratio of approximately `10:14`.
Thus, I decided that my in-game cards should be rendered at 1000×1400 pixels,
and I should draw all my images with this scale in mind.

Note that the exact pixel dimensions are somewhat irrelevant here, since the
images will in the end be scaled up or down, according to the device's actual
resolution. Here I'm using probably a bigger resolution than necessary for
phones, but it would also work nicely for larger devices like an iPad.

And now, without further ado, here's my graphic asset for the Klondike game
(I'm not an artist, so don't judge too harshly):

![Klondike sprites](app/assets/images/klondike-sprites.png)

Right-click the image, choose "Save as...", and store it in the `assets/images`
folder of the project. At this point our project's structure looks like this
(there are other files too, of course, but these are the important ones):

```text
klondike/
 ├─assets/
 │  └─images/
 │     └─klondike-sprites.png
 ├─lib/
 │  └─main.dart
 └─pubspec.yaml
```

By the way, this kind of file is called the **sprite sheet**: it's just a
collection of multiple independent images in a single file. We are using a
sprite sheet here for the simple reason that loading a single large image is
faster than many small images. In addition, rendering sprites that were
extracted from a single source image can be faster too, since Flutter will
optimize multiple such drawing commands into a single `drawAtlas` command.

Here are the contents of my sprite sheet:

- Numerals 2, 3, 4, ..., K, A. In theory, we could have rendered these in the
  game as text strings, but then we would need to also include a font as an
  asset -- seems simpler to just have them as images instead.
- Suit marks: ♥, ♦, ♣, ♠. Again, we could have used Unicode characters for
  these, but images are much easier to position precisely.
  - In case you're wondering why these are yellow/blue instead of red/black
    -- turns out, black symbols don't look very nice on a dark background,
    so I had to adjust the color scheme.
- Flame logo, for use on the backs of the cards.
- Pictures of a Jack, a Queen, and a King. Normally there would be four times
  more of these, with a different character for each suite, but I got too
  tired drawing these.

Also, you need to tell Flutter about this image (just having it inside the
`assets` folder is not enough). In order to do this, let's add the following
lines into the `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
flutter:
  assets:
    - assets/images/
```

Alright, enough with preparing -- onward to coding!

# 2. Scaffolding

In this section we will use broad strokes to outline the main elements of the
game. This includes the main game class, and the general layout.

## KlondikeGame

In Flame universe, the **FlameGame** class is the cornerstone of most games.
This class runs the game loop, dispatches events, owns all the components that
comprise the game (the component tree), and usually also serves as the central
repository for the game's state.

So, create a new file called `klondike_game.dart` inside the `lib/` folder, and
declare the `KlondikeGame` class inside:

```dart
import 'package:flame/game.dart';
import 'package:flame/flame.dart';

class KlondikeGame extends FlameGame {
  @override
  Future<void> onLoad() async {
    await Flame.images.load('klondike-sprites.png');
  }
}
```

For now we only declared the `onLoad` method, which is a special handler that
is called when the game instance is attached to the Flutter widget tree for the
first time. You can think of it as a delayed asynchronous constructor.
Currently, the only thing that `onLoad` does is that it loads the sprites image
into the game; but we will be adding more soon. Any image or other resource that
you want to use in the game needs to be loaded first, which is a relatively slow
I/O operation, hence the need for `await` keyword.

I am loading the image into the global `Flame.images` cache here. An alternative
approach is to load it into the `Game.images` cache instead, but then it would
have been more difficult to access that image from other classes.

Also note that I am `await`ing the image to finish loading before initializing
anything else in the game. This is for convenience: it means that by the time
all other components are initialized, they can assume the sprite sheet is already
loaded. We can even add a helper function to extract a sprite from the common
sprite sheet:

```dart
Sprite klondikeSprite(double x, double y, double width, double height) {
  return Sprite(
    Flame.images.fromCache('klondike-sprites.png'),
    srcPosition: Vector2(x, y),
    srcSize: Vector2(width, height),
  );
}
```

This helper function won't be needed in this chapter, but will be used
extensively in the next.

Let's incorporate this class into the project so that it isn't orphaned. Open
the `main.dart` find the line which says `final game = FlameGame();` and replace
the `FlameGame` with `KlondikeGame`. You will need to import the class too.
After all is done, the file should look like this:

```dart
import 'package:flame/game.dart';
import 'package:flutter/widgets.dart';
import 'klondike_game.dart';

void main() {
  final game = KlondikeGame();
  runApp(GameWidget(game: game));
}
```

## Other classes

So far we have the main `KlondikeGame` class, and now we need to create objects
that we will add to the game. In Flame these objects are called _components_,
and when added to the game they form a "game component tree". All entities that
exist in the game must be components.

As we already mentioned in the previous chapter, our game mainly consists of
`Card` components. However, since drawing the cards will take some effort, we
will defer implementation of that class to the next chapter.

For now, let's create the container classes, as shown on the sketch. These are:
`Stock`, `Waste`, `Pile` and `Foundation`. Inside the `lib/` folder create a
sub-directory `components`, and then the file `lib/components/stock.dart`. In that
file write

```dart
import 'package:flame/components.dart';

class Stock extends PositionComponent {
  @override
  bool get debugMode => true;
}
```

Here we declare the `Stock` class as a `PositionComponent` (which is a component
that has a position and size). We also turn on the debug mode for this class so
that we can see it on the screen even though we don't have any rendering logic
yet.

Likewise, create three more classes `Foundation`, `Pile` and `Waste`, each in
its corresponding file. For now all four classes will have exactly the same
logic inside, we'll be adding more functionality into those classes in
subsequent chapters.

At this moment the directory structure of your game should look like this:

```text
klondike/
 ├─assets/
 │  └─images/
 │     └─klondike-sprites.png
 ├─lib/

## Game structure

Once we have some basic components, they need to be added to the game. It is
time to make a decision about the high-level structure of the game.

There exist multiple approaches here, which differ in their complexity,
extendability, and overall philosophy. The approach that we will be taking in
this tutorial is based on using the [World] component, together with a [Camera].

The idea behind this approach is the following: imagine that your game **world**
exists independently from the device, that it exists already in our heads, and
on the sketch, even though we haven't done any coding yet. This world will have
a certain size, and each element in the world will have certain coordinates. It
is up to us to decide what will be the size of the world, and what is the unit
of measurement for that size. The important part is that the world exists
independently from the device, and its dimensions likewise do not depend on the
pixel resolution of the screen.

All elements that are part of the world will be added to the `World` component,
and the `World` component will be then added to the game.

The second part of the overall structure is a **camera** (`CameraComponent`).
The purpose of the camera is to be able to look at the world, to make sure that
it renders at the right size on the screen of the user's device.

Thus, the overall structure of the component tree will look approximately like
this:

```text
KlondikeGame
 ├─ World
 │   ├─ Stock
 │   ├─ Waste
 │   ├─ Foundation (×4)
 │   └─ Pile (×7)
 └─ CameraComponent
```

For this game I've been drawing my image assets having in mind the dimension of
a single card at 1000×1400 pixels. So, this will serve as the reference size for
determining the overall layout. Another important measurement that affects the
layout is the inter-card distance. It seems like it should be somewhere between
150 to 200 units (relative to the card width), so we will declare it as a
variable `cardGap` that can be adjusted later if needed. For simplicity, both
the vertical and horizontal inter-card distance will be the same, and the
minimum padding between the cards and the edges of the screen will also be equal
to `cardGap`.

Alright, let's put all this together and implement our `KlondikeGame` class.

First, we declare several global constants which describe the dimensions of a
card and the distance between cards. We declare them as constants because we are
not planning to change these values during the game:

```dart
  static const double cardWidth = 1000.0;
  static const double cardHeight = 1400.0;
  static const double cardGap = 175.0;
  static const double cardRadius = 100.0;
  static final Vector2 cardSize = Vector2(cardWidth, cardHeight);
```

Next, we will create a `Stock` component, the `Waste`, four `Foundation`s and
seven `Pile`s, setting their sizes and positions in the world. The positions
are calculated using simple arithmetics. This should all happen inside the
`onLoad` method, after loading the sprite sheet:

```dart
    final stock = Stock()
      ..size = cardSize
      ..position = Vector2(cardGap, cardGap);
    final waste = Waste()
      ..size = cardSize
      ..position = Vector2(cardWidth + 2 * cardGap, cardGap);
    final foundations = List.generate(
      4,
      (i) => Foundation()
        ..size = cardSize
        ..position =
            Vector2((i + 3) * (cardWidth + cardGap) + cardGap, cardGap),
    );
    final piles = List.generate(
      7,
      (i) => Pile()
        ..size = cardSize
        ..position = Vector2(
          cardGap + i * (cardWidth + cardGap),
          cardHeight + 2 * cardGap,
        ),
    );
```

Since Flame version 1.9.0, `FlameGame` sets up default `world` and `camera`
objects. `KlondikeGame` is an extension of `FlameGame`, so we can add to that
`world` all the components that we just created.

```dart
    world.add(stock);
    world.add(waste);
    world.addAll(foundations);
    world.addAll(piles);
```

```{note}
You may be wondering when you need to `await` the result of `add()`, and when
you don't. The short answer is: usually you don't need to wait, but if you want
to, then it won't hurt either.

If you check the documentation for `.add()` method, you'll see that the returned
future only waits until the component is finished loading, not until it is
actually mounted to the game. As such, you only have to wait for the future from
`.add()` if your logic requires that the component is fully loaded before it can
proceed. This is not very common.

If you don't `await` the future from `.add()`, then the component will be added
to the game anyways, and in the same amount of time.
```

Lastly, we use FlameGame's `camera` object to look at the `world`. Internally,
the camera consists of two parts: a **viewport** and a **viewfinder**. The
default viewport is `MaxViewport`, which takes up the entire available screen
size -- this is exactly what we need for our game, so no need to change
anything. The viewfinder, on the other hand, needs to be set up to take the
dimensions of the underlying world into account.

We want the entire card layout to be visible on the screen without the need to
scroll. In order to accomplish this, we specify that we want the entire world
size (which is `7*cardWidth + 8*cardGap` by `4*cardHeight + 3*cardGap`) to be
able to fit into the screen. The `.visibleGameSize` setting ensures that no
matter the size of the device, the zoom level will be adjusted such that the
specified chunk of the game world will be visible.

The game size calculation is obtained like this: there are 7 cards in the
tableau and 6 gaps between them, add 2 more "gaps" to account for padding, and
you get the width of `7*cardWidth + 8*cardGap`. Vertically, there are two rows
of cards, but in the bottom row we need some extra space to be able to display
a tall pile -- by my rough estimate, thrice the height of a card is sufficient
for this -- which gives the total height of the game world as
`4*cardHeight + 3*cardGap`.

Next, we specify which part of the world will be in the "center" of the
viewport. In this case I specify that the "center" of the viewport should
be at the top center of the screen, and the corresponding point within
the game world is at coordinates `[(7*cardWidth + 8*cardGap)/2, 0]`.

The reason for such choice for the viewfinder's position and anchor is
because of how we want it to respond if the game size becomes too wide or
too tall: in case of too wide we want it to be centered on the screen,
but if the screen is too tall, we want the content to be aligned at the
top.

```dart
    camera.viewfinder.visibleGameSize =
           Vector2(cardWidth * 7 + cardGap * 8, 4 * cardHeight + 3 * cardGap);
    camera.viewfinder.position = Vector2(cardWidth * 3.5 + cardGap * 4, 0);
    camera.viewfinder.anchor = Anchor.topCenter;
```

If you run the game now, you should see the placeholders for where the various
components will be. If you are running the game in the browser, try resizing the
window and see how the game responds to this.

And this is it with this step -- we've created the basic game structure upon
which everything else will be built. In the next step, we'll learn how to render
the card objects, which are the most important visual objects in this game.

# 3. Cards

In this chapter we will begin implementing the most visible component in the
game -- the **Card** component, which corresponds to a single real-life card.
There will be 52 `Card` objects in the game.

Each card has a **rank** (from 1 to 13, where 1 is an Ace, and 13 is a King)
and a **suit** (from 0 to 3: hearts ♥, diamonds ♦, clubs ♣, and spades ♠).
Also, each card will have a boolean flag **faceUp**, which controls whether
the card is currently facing up or down. This property is important both for
rendering, and for certain aspects of the gameplay logic.

The rank and the suit are simple properties of a card, they aren't components,
so we need to make a decision on how to represent them. There are several
possibilities: either as a simple `int`, or as an `enum`, or as objects. The
choice will depend on what operations we need to perform with them. For the
rank, we will need to be able to tell whether one rank is one higher/lower than
another rank. Also, we need to produce the text label and a sprite corresponding
to the given rank. For suits, we need to know whether two suits are of different
colors, and also produce a text label and a sprite. Given these requirements,
I decided to represent both `Rank` and `Suit` as classes.

## Suit

Create file `suit.dart` and declare an `@immutable class Suit` there, with no
parent. The `@immutable` annotation here is just a hint for us that the objects
of this class should not be modified after creation.

Next, we define the factory constructor for the class: `Suit.fromInt(i)`. We
use a factory constructor here in order to enforce the singleton pattern for
the class: instead of creating a new object every time, we are returning one
of the pre-built objects that we store in the `_singletons` list:

```dart
  factory Suit.fromInt(int index) {
    assert(index >= 0 && index <= 3);
    return _singletons[index];
  }
```

After that, there is a private constructor `Suit._()`. This constructor
initializes the main properties of each `Suit` object: the numeric value, the
string label, and the sprite object which we will later use to draw the suit
symbol on the canvas. The sprite object is initialized using the
`klondikeSprite()` function that we created in the previous chapter:

```dart
  Suit._(this.value, this.label, double x, double y, double w, double h)
      : sprite = klondikeSprite(x, y, w, h);

  final int value;
  final String label;
  final Sprite sprite;
```

Then comes the static list of all `Suit` objects in the game. Note that we
define it as static variable so it is evaluated lazily (as if it was marked
with the `late` keyword) meaning that it will be only initialized the first
time it is needed. This is important: as we can see above, the constructor
tries to retrieve an image from the global cache, so it can only be invoked
after the image is loaded into the cache.

```dart
  static final List<Suit> _singletons = [
    Suit._(0, '♥', 1176, 17, 172, 183),
    Suit._(1, '♦', 973, 14, 177, 182),
    Suit._(2, '♣', 974, 226, 184, 172),
    Suit._(3, '♠', 1178, 220, 176, 182),
  ];
```

The last four numbers in the constructor are the coordinates of the sprite
image within the sprite sheet `klondike-sprites.png`. If you're wondering how I
obtained these numbers, the answer is that I used a free online service
[spritecow.com] -- it's a handy tool for locating sprites within a sprite sheet.

Lastly, I have simple getters to determine the "color" of a suit. This will be
needed later when we need to enforce the rule that cards can only be placed
into columns by alternating colors.

```dart
  /// Hearts and Diamonds are red, while Clubs and Spades are black.
  bool get isRed => value <= 1;
  bool get isBlack => value >= 2;
```

## Rank

The `Rank` class is very similar to `Suit`. The main difference is that `Rank`
contains two sprites instead of one, separately for ranks of "red" and "black"
colors. The full code for the `Rank` class is as follows:

```dart
import 'package:flame/components.dart';
import 'package:flame/flame.dart';
import 'package:flutter/foundation.dart';

@immutable
class Rank {
  factory Rank.fromInt(int value) {
    assert(value >= 1 && value <= 13);
    return _singletons[value - 1];
  }

  Rank._(
    this.value,
    this.label,
    double x1,
    double y1,
    double x2,
    double y2,
    double w,
    double h,
  )   : redSprite = klondikeSprite(x1, y1, w, h),
        blackSprite = klondikeSprite(x2, y2, w, h);

  final int value;
  final String label;
  final Sprite redSprite;
  final Sprite blackSprite;

  static final List<Rank> _singletons = [
    Rank._(1, 'A', 335, 164, 789, 161, 120, 129),
    Rank._(2, '2', 20, 19, 15, 322, 83, 125),
    Rank._(3, '3', 122, 19, 117, 322, 80, 127),
    Rank._(4, '4', 213, 12, 208, 315, 93, 132),
    Rank._(5, '5', 314, 21, 309, 324, 85, 125),
    Rank._(6, '6', 419, 17, 414, 320, 84, 129),
    Rank._(7, '7', 509, 21, 505, 324, 92, 128),
    Rank._(8, '8', 612, 19, 607, 322, 78, 127),
    Rank._(9, '9', 709, 19, 704, 322, 84, 130),
    Rank._(10, '10', 810, 20, 805, 322, 137, 127),
    Rank._(11, 'J', 15, 170, 469, 167, 56, 126),
    Rank._(12, 'Q', 92, 168, 547, 165, 132, 128),
    Rank._(13, 'K', 243, 170, 696, 167, 92, 123),
  ];
}
```

## Card component

Now that we have the `Rank` and the `Suit` classes, we can finally start
implementing the **Card** component. Create file `components/card.dart` and
declare the `Card` class extending from the `PositionComponent`:

```dart
class Card extends PositionComponent {}
```

The constructor of the class will take integer rank and suit, and make the
card initially facing down. Also, we initialize the size of the component to
be equal to the `cardSize` constant defined in the `KlondikeGame` class:

```dart
  Card(int intRank, int intSuit)
      : rank = Rank.fromInt(intRank),
        suit = Suit.fromInt(intSuit),
        _faceUp = false,
        super(size: KlondikeGame.cardSize);

  final Rank rank;
  final Suit suit;
  bool _faceUp;
```

The `_faceUp` property is private (indicated by the underscore) and non-final,
meaning that it can change during the lifetime of a card. We should create some
public accessors and mutators for this variable:

```dart
  bool get isFaceUp => _faceUp;
  bool get isFaceDown => !_faceUp;
  void flip() => _faceUp = !_faceUp;
```

Lastly, let's add a simple `toString()` implementation, which may turn out to
be useful when we need to debug the game:

```dart
  @override
  String toString() => rank.label + suit.label; // e.g. "Q♠" or "10♦"
```

Before we proceed with implementing the rendering, we need to add some cards
into the game. Head over to the `KlondikeGame` class and add the following at
the bottom of the `onLoad` method:

```dart
    final random = Random();
    for (var i = 0; i < 7; i++) {
      for (var j = 0; j < 4; j++) {
        final card = Card(random.nextInt(13) + 1, random.nextInt(4))
          ..position = Vector2(100 + i * 1150, 100 + j * 1500)
          ..addToParent(world);
        if (random.nextDouble() < 0.9) { // flip face up with 90% probability
          card.flip();
        }
      }
    }
```

This snippet is a temporary code -- we will remove it in the next chapter --
but for now it lays down 28 random cards on the table, most of them facing up.

### Rendering

In order to be able to see a card, we need to implement its `render()` method.
Since the card has two distinct states -- face up or down -- we will
implement rendering for these two states separately. Add the following methods
into the `Card` class:

```dart
  @override
  void render(Canvas canvas) {
    if (_faceUp) {
      _renderFront(canvas);
    } else {
      _renderBack(canvas);
    }
  }

  void _renderFront(Canvas canvas) {}
  void _renderBack(Canvas canvas) {}
```

### renderBack()

Since rendering the back of a card is simpler, we will do it first.

The `render()` method of a `PositionComponent` operates in a local coordinate
system, which means we don't need to worry about where the card is located on
the screen. This local coordinate system has the origin at the top-left corner
of the component, and extends to the right by `width` and down by `height`
pixels.

There is a lot of artistic freedom in how to draw the back of a card, but my
implementation contains a solid background, a border, a flame logo in the
middle, and another decorative border:

```dart
  void _renderBack(Canvas canvas) {
    canvas.drawRRect(cardRRect, backBackgroundPaint);
    canvas.drawRRect(cardRRect, backBorderPaint1);
    canvas.drawRRect(backRRectInner, backBorderPaint2);
    flameSprite.render(canvas, position: size / 2, anchor: Anchor.center);
  }
```

The most interesting part here is the rendering of a sprite: we want to
render it in the middle (`size/2`), and we use `Anchor.center` to tell the
engine that we want the _center_ of the sprite to be at that point.

Various properties used in the `_renderBack()` method are defined as follows:

```dart
  static final Paint backBackgroundPaint = Paint()
    ..color = const Color(0xff380c02);
  static final Paint backBorderPaint1 = Paint()
    ..color = const Color(0xffdbaf58)
    ..style = PaintingStyle.stroke
    ..strokeWidth = 10;
  static final Paint backBorderPaint2 = Paint()
    ..color = const Color(0x5CEF971B)
    ..style = PaintingStyle.stroke
    ..strokeWidth = 35;
  static final RRect cardRRect = RRect.fromRectAndRadius(
    KlondikeGame.cardSize.toRect(),
    const Radius.circular(KlondikeGame.cardRadius),
  );
  static final RRect backRRectInner = cardRRect.deflate(40);
  static final Sprite flameSprite = klondikeSprite(1367, 6, 357, 501);
```

I declared these properties as static because they will all be the same across
all 52 card objects, so we might as well save some resources by having them
initialized only once.

### renderFront()

When rendering the face of a card, we will follow the standard card design: the
rank and the suit in two opposite corners, plus the number of pips equal to the
rank value. The court cards (jack, queen, king) will have special images in the
center.

As before, we begin by declaring some constants that will be used for rendering.
The background of a card will be black, whereas the border will be different
depending on whether the card is of a "red" suit or "black":

```dart
  static final Paint frontBackgroundPaint = Paint()
    ..color = const Color(0xff000000);
  static final Paint redBorderPaint = Paint()
    ..color = const Color(0xffece8a3)
    ..style = PaintingStyle.stroke
    ..strokeWidth = 10;
  static final Paint blackBorderPaint = Paint()
    ..color = const Color(0xff7ab2e8)
    ..style = PaintingStyle.stroke
    ..strokeWidth = 10;
```

Next, we also need the images for the court cards:

```dart
  static final Sprite redJack = klondikeSprite(81, 565, 562, 488);
  static final Sprite redQueen = klondikeSprite(717, 541, 486, 515);
  static final Sprite redKing = klondikeSprite(1305, 532, 407, 549);
```

Note that I'm calling these sprites `redJack`, `redQueen`, and `redKing`. This
is because, after some trial, I found that the images that I have don't look
very well on black-suit cards. So what I decided to do is to take these images
and _tint_ them with a blueish hue. Tinting of a sprite can be achieved by
using a paint with `colorFilter` set to the specified color and the `srcATop`
blending mode:

```dart
  static final blueFilter = Paint()
    ..colorFilter = const ColorFilter.mode(
      Color(0x880d8bff),
      BlendMode.srcATop,
    );
  static final Sprite blackJack = klondikeSprite(81, 565, 562, 488)
    ..paint = blueFilter;
  static final Sprite blackQueen = klondikeSprite(717, 541, 486, 515)
    ..paint = blueFilter;
  static final Sprite blackKing = klondikeSprite(1305, 532, 407, 549)
    ..paint = blueFilter;
```

Now we can start coding the render method itself. First, draw the background
and the card border:

```dart
  void _renderFront(Canvas canvas) {
    canvas.drawRRect(cardRRect, frontBackgroundPaint);
    canvas.drawRRect(
      cardRRect,
      suit.isRed ? redBorderPaint : blackBorderPaint,
    );
  }
```

In order to draw the rest of the card, I need one more helper method. This
method will draw the provided sprite on the canvas at the specified place (the
location is relative to the dimensions of the card). The sprite can be
optionally scaled. In addition, if flag `rotate=true` is passed, the sprite
will be drawn as if it was rotated 180º around the center of the card:

```dart
  void _drawSprite(
    Canvas canvas,
    Sprite sprite,
    double relativeX,
    double relativeY, {
    double scale = 1,
    bool rotate = false,
  }) {
    if (rotate) {
      canvas.save();
      canvas.translate(size.x / 2, size.y / 2);
      canvas.rotate(pi);
      canvas.translate(-size.x / 2, -size.y / 2);
    }
    sprite.render(
      canvas,
      position: Vector2(relativeX * size.x, relativeY * size.y),
      anchor: Anchor.center,
      size: sprite.srcSize.scaled(scale),
    );
    if (rotate) {
      canvas.restore();
    }
  }
```

Let's draw the rank and the suit symbols in the corners of the card. Add the
following to the `_renderFront()` method:

```dart
    final rankSprite = suit.isBlack ? rank.blackSprite : rank.redSprite;
    final suitSprite = suit.sprite;
    _drawSprite(canvas, rankSprite, 0.1, 0.08);
    _drawSprite(canvas, rankSprite, 0.1, 0.08, rotate: true);
    _drawSprite(canvas, suitSprite, 0.1, 0.18, scale: 0.5);
    _drawSprite(canvas, suitSprite, 0.1, 0.18, scale: 0.5, rotate: true);
```

The middle of the card is rendered in the same manner: we will create a big
switch statement on the card's rank, and draw pips accordingly. The code
below may seem long, but it is actually quite repetitive and consists only
of drawing various sprites in different places on the card's face:

```dart
    switch (rank.value) {
      case 1:
        _drawSprite(canvas, suitSprite, 0.5, 0.5, scale: 2.5);
      case 2:
        _drawSprite(canvas, suitSprite, 0.5, 0.25);
        _drawSprite(canvas, suitSprite, 0.5, 0.25, rotate: true);
      case 3:
        _drawSprite(canvas, suitSprite, 0.5, 0.2);
        _drawSprite(canvas, suitSprite, 0.5, 0.5);
        _drawSprite(canvas, suitSprite, 0.5, 0.2, rotate: true);
      case 4:
        _drawSprite(canvas, suitSprite, 0.3, 0.25);
        _drawSprite(canvas, suitSprite, 0.7, 0.25);
        _drawSprite(canvas, suitSprite, 0.3, 0.25, rotate: true);
        _drawSprite(canvas, suitSprite, 0.7, 0.25, rotate: true);
      case 5:
        _drawSprite(canvas, suitSprite, 0.3, 0.25);
        _drawSprite(canvas, suitSprite, 0.7, 0.25);
        _drawSprite(canvas, suitSprite, 0.3, 0.25, rotate: true);
        _drawSprite(canvas, suitSprite, 0.7, 0.25, rotate: true);
        _drawSprite(canvas, suitSprite, 0.5, 0.5);
      case 6:
        _drawSprite(canvas, suitSprite, 0.3, 0.25);
        _drawSprite(canvas, suitSprite, 0.7, 0.25);
        _drawSprite(canvas, suitSprite, 0.3, 0.5);
        _drawSprite(canvas, suitSprite, 0.7, 0.5);
        _drawSprite(canvas, suitSprite, 0.3, 0.25, rotate: true);
        _drawSprite(canvas, suitSprite, 0.7, 0.25, rotate: true);
      case 7:
        _drawSprite(canvas, suitSprite, 0.3, 0.2);
        _drawSprite(canvas, suitSprite, 0.7, 0.2);
        _drawSprite(canvas, suitSprite, 0.5, 0.35);
        _drawSprite(canvas, suitSprite, 0.3, 0.5);
        _drawSprite(canvas, suitSprite, 0.7, 0.5);
        _drawSprite(canvas, suitSprite, 0.3, 0.2, rotate: true);
        _drawSprite(canvas, suitSprite, 0.7, 0.2, rotate: true);
      case 8:
        _drawSprite(canvas, suitSprite, 0.3, 0.2);
        _drawSprite(canvas, suitSprite, 0.7, 0.2);
        _drawSprite(canvas, suitSprite, 0.5, 0.35);
        _drawSprite(canvas, suitSprite, 0.3, 0.5);
        _drawSprite(canvas, suitSprite, 0.7, 0.5);
        _drawSprite(canvas, suitSprite, 0.3, 0.2, rotate: true);
        _drawSprite(canvas, suitSprite, 0.7, 0.2, rotate: true);
        _drawSprite(canvas, suitSprite, 0.5, 0.35, rotate: true);
      case 9:
        _drawSprite(canvas, suitSprite, 0.3, 0.2);
        _drawSprite(canvas, suitSprite, 0.7, 0.2);
        _drawSprite(canvas, suitSprite, 0.5, 0.3);
        _drawSprite(canvas, suitSprite, 0.3, 0.4);
        _drawSprite(canvas, suitSprite, 0.7, 0.4);
        _drawSprite(canvas, suitSprite, 0.3, 0.2, rotate: true);
        _drawSprite(canvas, suitSprite, 0.7, 0.2, rotate: true);
        _drawSprite(canvas, suitSprite, 0.3, 0.4, rotate: true);
        _drawSprite(canvas, suitSprite, 0.7, 0.4, rotate: true);
      case 10:
        _drawSprite(canvas, suitSprite, 0.3, 0.2);
        _drawSprite(canvas, suitSprite, 0.7, 0.2);
        _drawSprite(canvas, suitSprite, 0.5, 0.3);
        _drawSprite(canvas, suitSprite, 0.3, 0.4);
        _drawSprite(canvas, suitSprite, 0.7, 0.4);
        _drawSprite(canvas, suitSprite, 0.3, 0.2, rotate: true);
        _drawSprite(canvas, suitSprite, 0.7, 0.2, rotate: true);
        _drawSprite(canvas, suitSprite, 0.5, 0.3, rotate: true);
        _drawSprite(canvas, suitSprite, 0.3, 0.4, rotate: true);
        _drawSprite(canvas, suitSprite, 0.7, 0.4, rotate: true);
      case 11:
        _drawSprite(canvas, suit.isRed? redJack : blackJack, 0.5, 0.5);
      case 12:
        _drawSprite(canvas, suit.isRed? redQueen : blackQueen, 0.5, 0.5);
      case 13:
        _drawSprite(canvas, suit.isRed? redKing : blackKing, 0.5, 0.5);
    }
```

And this is it with the rendering of the `Card` component. If you run the code
now, you would see four rows of cards neatly spread on the table. Refreshing
the page will lay down a new set of cards. Remember that we have laid these
cards in this way only temporarily, in order to be able to check that rendering
works properly.

In the next chapter we will discuss how to implement interactions with the
cards, that is, how to make them draggable and tappable.

# 4. Gameplay

In this chapter we will be implementing the core of Klondike's gameplay: how the cards move between
the stock and the waste, the piles and the foundations.

Before we begin though, let's clean up all those cards that we left scattered across the table in
the previous chapter. Open the `KlondikeGame` class and erase the loop at the bottom of `onLoad()`
that was adding 28 cards onto the table.

## The piles

Another small refactoring that we need to do is to rename our components: `Stock` ⇒ `StockPile`,
`Waste` ⇒ `WastePile`, `Foundation` ⇒ `FoundationPile`, and `Pile` ⇒ `TableauPile`. This is
because these components have some common features in how they handle interactions with the cards,
and it would be convenient to have all of them implement a common API. We will call the interface
that they will all be implementing the `Pile` class.

```{note}
Refactors and changes in architecture happen during development all the time:
it's almost impossible to get the structure right on the first try. Do not be
anxious about changing code that you have written in the past: it is a good
habit to have.
```

After such a rename, we can begin implementing each of these components.

### Stock pile

The **stock** is a place in the top-left corner of the playing field which holds the cards that are
not currently in play. We will need to build the following functionality for this component:

1. Ability to hold cards that are not currently in play, face down;
2. Tapping the stock should reveal top 3 cards and move them to the **waste** pile;
3. When the cards run out, there should be a visual indicating that this is the stock pile;
4. When the cards run out, tapping the empty stock should move all the cards from the waste pile
   into the stock, turning them face down.

The first question that needs to be decided here is this: who is going to own the `Card` components?
Previously we have been adding them directly to the game field, but now wouldn't it be better to
say that the cards belong to the `Stock` component, or to the waste, or piles, or foundations? While
this approach is tempting, I believe it would make our life more complicated as we need to move a
card from one place to another.

So, I decided to stick with my first approach: the `Card` components are owned directly by the
`KlondikeGame` itself, whereas the `StockPile` and other piles are merely aware of which cards are
currently placed there.

Having this in mind, let's start implementing the `StockPile` component:

```dart
class StockPile extends PositionComponent {
  StockPile({super.position}) : super(size: KlondikeGame.cardSize);

  /// Which cards are currently placed onto this pile. The first card in the
  /// list is at the bottom, the last card is on top.
  final List<Card> _cards = [];

  void acquireCard(Card card) {
    assert(!card.isFaceUp);
    card.position = position;
    card.priority = _cards.length;
    _cards.add(card);
  }
}
```

Here the `acquireCard()` method stores the provided card into the internal list `_cards`; it also
moves that card to the `StockPile`'s position and adjusts the cards priority so that they are
displayed in the right order. However, this method does not mount the card as a child of the
`StockPile` component -- it remains belonging to the top-level game.

Speaking of the game class, let's open the `KlondikeGame` and add the following lines to create a
full deck of 52 cards and put them onto the stock pile (this should be added at the end of the
`onLoad` method):

```dart
final cards = [
  for (var rank = 1; rank <= 13; rank++)
    for (var suit = 0; suit < 4; suit++)
      Card(rank, suit)
];
world.addAll(cards);
cards.forEach(stock.acquireCard);
```

This concludes the first step of our short plan at the beginning of this section. For the second
step, though, we need to have a waste pile -- so let's make a quick detour and implement the
`WastePile` class.

### Waste pile

The **waste** is a pile next to the stock. During the course of the game we will be taking the cards
from the top of the stock pile and putting them into the waste. The functionality of this class is
quite simple: it holds a certain number of cards face up, fanning out the top 3.

Let's start implementing the `WastePile` class same way as we did with the `StockPile` class, only
now the cards are expected to be face up:

```dart
class WastePile extends PositionComponent {
  WastePile({super.position}) : super(size: KlondikeGame.cardSize);

  final List<Card> _cards = [];

  void acquireCard(Card card) {
    assert(card.isFaceUp);
    card.position = position;
    card.priority = _cards.length;
    _cards.add(card);
  }
}
```

So far, this puts all cards into a single neat pile, whereas we wanted a fan-out of top three. So,
let's add a dedicated method `_fanOutTopCards()` for this, which we will call at the end of each
`acquireCard()`:

```dart
  void _fanOutTopCards() {
    final n = _cards.length;
    for (var i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      _cards[i].position = position;
    }
    if (n == 2) {
      _cards[1].position.add(_fanOffset);
    } else if (n >= 3) {
      _cards[n - 2].position.add(_fanOffset);
      _cards[n - 1].position.addScaled(_fanOffset, 2);
    }
  }
```

The `_fanOffset` variable here helps determine the shift between cards in the fan, which I decided
to be about 20% of the card's width:

```dart
  final Vector2 _fanOffset = Vector2(KlondikeGame.cardWidth * 0.2, 0);
```

Now that the waste pile is ready, let's get back to the `StockPile`.

### Stock pile -- tap to deal cards

The second item on our todo list is the first interactive functionality in the game: tap the stock
pile to deal 3 cards onto the waste.

Adding tap functionality to the components in Flame is quite simple: we just add the mixin
`TapCallbacks` to the component that we want to be tappable:

```dart
class StockPile extends PositionComponent with TapCallbacks { ... }
```

Oh, and we also need to say what we want to happen when the tap occurs. Here we want the top 3 cards
to be turned face up and moved to the waste pile. So, add the following method to the `StockPile`
class:

```dart
  @override
  void onTapUp(TapUpEvent event) {
  final wastePile = parent!.firstChild<WastePile>()!;
    for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
      if (_cards.isNotEmpty) {
        final card = _cards.removeLast();
        card.flip();
        wastePile.acquireCard(card);
      }
    }
  }
```

You have probably noticed that the cards move from one pile to another immediately, which looks very
unnatural. However, this is how it is going to be for now -- we will defer making the game more
smooth till the next chapter of the tutorial.

Also, the cards are organized in a well-defined order right now, starting from Kings and ending with
Aces. This doesn't make a very exciting gameplay though, so add line

```dart
    cards.shuffle();
```

in the `KlondikeGame` class right after the list of cards is created.

### Stock pile -- visual representation

Currently, when the stock pile has no cards, it simply shows an empty space -- there is no visual
cue that this is where the stock is. Such cue is needed, though, because we want the user to be
able to click the stock pile when it is empty in order to move all the cards from the waste back to
the stock so that they can be dealt again.

In our case, the empty stock pile will have a card-like border, and a circle in the middle:

```dart
  @override
  void render(Canvas canvas) {
    canvas.drawRRect(KlondikeGame.cardRRect, _borderPaint);
    canvas.drawCircle(
      Offset(width / 2, height / 2),
      KlondikeGame.cardWidth * 0.3,
      _circlePaint,
    );
  }
```

where the paints are defined as

```dart
  final _borderPaint = Paint()
    ..style = PaintingStyle.stroke
    ..strokeWidth = 10
    ..color = const Color(0xFF3F5B5D);
  final _circlePaint = Paint()
    ..style = PaintingStyle.stroke
    ..strokeWidth = 100
    ..color = const Color(0x883F5B5D);
```

and the `cardRRect` in the `KlondikeGame` class as

```dart
  static final cardRRect = RRect.fromRectAndRadius(
    const Rect.fromLTWH(0, 0, cardWidth, cardHeight),
    const Radius.circular(cardRadius),
  );
```

Now when you click through the stock pile till the end, you should be able to see the placeholder
for the stock cards.

### Stock pile -- refill from the waste

The last piece of functionality to add, is to move the cards back from the waste pile into the stock
pile when the user taps on an empty stock. To implement this, we will modify the `onTapUp()` method
like so:

```dart
  @override
  void onTapUp(TapUpEvent event) {
    final wastePile = parent!.firstChild<WastePile>()!;
    if (_cards.isEmpty) {
      wastePile.removeAllCards().reversed.forEach((card) {
        card.flip();
        acquireCard(card);
      });
    } else {
      for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        if (_cards.isNotEmpty) {
          final card = _cards.removeLast();
          card.flip();
          wastePile.acquireCard(card);
        }
      }
    }
  }
```

If you're curious why we needed to reverse the list of cards removed from the waste pile, then it is
because we want to simulate the entire waste pile being turned over at once, and not each card being
flipped one by one in their places. You can check that this is working as intended by verifying that
on each subsequent run through the stock pile, the cards are dealt in the same order as they were
dealt in the first run.

The method `WastePile.removeAllCards()` still needs to be implemented though:

```dart
  List<Card> removeAllCards() {
    final cards = _cards.toList();
    _cards.clear();
    return cards;
  }
```

This pretty much concludes the `StockPile` functionality, and we already implemented the `WastePile`
-- so the only two components remaining are the `FoundationPile` and the `TableauPile`. We'll start
with the first one because it looks simpler.

### Foundation piles

The **foundation** piles are the four piles in the top right corner of the game. This is where we
will be building the ordered runs of cards from Ace to King. The functionality of this class is
similar to the `StockPile` and the `WastePile`: it has to be able to hold cards face up, and there
has to be some visual to show where the foundation is when there are no cards there.

First, let's implement the card-holding logic:

```dart
class FoundationPile extends PositionComponent {
  FoundationPile({super.position}) : super(size: KlondikeGame.cardSize);

  final List<Card> _cards = [];

  void acquireCard(Card card) {
    assert(card.isFaceUp);
    card.position = position;
    card.priority = _cards.length;
    _cards.add(card);
  }
}
```

For visual representation of a foundation, I've decided to make a large icon of that foundation's
suit, in grey color. Which means we'd need to update the definition of the class to include the
suit information:

```dart
class FoundationPile extends PositionComponent {
  FoundationPile(int intSuit, {super.position})
      : suit = Suit.fromInt(intSuit),
        super(size: KlondikeGame.cardSize);

  final Suit suit;
  ...
}
```

The code in the `KlondikeGame` class that generates the foundations will have to be adjusted
accordingly in order to pass the suit index to each foundation.

Now, the rendering code for the foundation pile will look like this:

```dart
  @override
  void render(Canvas canvas) {
    canvas.drawRRect(KlondikeGame.cardRRect, _borderPaint);
    suit.sprite.render(
      canvas,
      position: size / 2,
      anchor: Anchor.center,
      size: Vector2.all(KlondikeGame.cardWidth * 0.6),
      overridePaint: _suitPaint,
    );
  }
```

Here we need to have two paint objects, one for the border and one for the suits:

```dart
  final _borderPaint = Paint()
    ..style = PaintingStyle.stroke
    ..strokeWidth = 10
    ..color = const Color(0x50ffffff);
  late final _suitPaint = Paint()
    ..color = suit.isRed? const Color(0x3a000000) : const Color(0x64000000)
    ..blendMode = BlendMode.luminosity;
```

The suit paint uses `BlendMode.luminosity` in order to convert the regular yellow/blue colors of
the suit sprites into grayscale. The "color" of the paint is different depending whether the suit
is red or black because the original luminosity of those sprites is different. Therefore, I had to
pick two different colors in order to make them look the same in grayscale.

### Tableau Piles

The last piece of the game to be implemented is the `TableauPile` component. There are seven of
these piles in total, and they are where the majority of the game play is happening.

The `TableauPile` also needs a visual representation, in order to indicate that it's a place where
a King can be placed when it is empty. I believe it could be just an empty frame, and that should
be sufficient:

```dart
class TableauPile extends PositionComponent {
  TableauPile({super.position}) : super(size: KlondikeGame.cardSize);

  final _borderPaint = Paint()
    ..style = PaintingStyle.stroke
    ..strokeWidth = 10
    ..color = const Color(0x50ffffff);

  @override
  void render(Canvas canvas) {
    canvas.drawRRect(KlondikeGame.cardRRect, _borderPaint);
  }
}
```

Oh, and the class will need to be able hold the cards too, obviously. Here, some of the cards will
be face down, while others will be face up. Also we will need a small amount of vertical fanning,
similar to how we did it for the `WastePile` component:

```dart
  /// Which cards are currently placed onto this pile.
  final List<Card> _cards = [];
  final Vector2 _fanOffset = Vector2(0, KlondikeGame.cardHeight * 0.05);

  void acquireCard(Card card) {
    if (_cards.isEmpty) {
      card.position = position;
    } else {
      card.position = _cards.last.position + _fanOffset;
    }
    card.priority = _cards.length;
    _cards.add(card);
  }
```

All that remains now is to head over to the `KlondikeGame` and make sure that the cards are dealt
into the `TableauPile`s at the beginning of the game. Modify the code at the end of the `onLoad()`
method so that it looks like this:

```dart
  @override
  Future<void> onLoad() async {
    ...

    final cards = [
      for (var rank = 1; rank <= 13; rank++)
        for (var suit = 0; suit < 4; suit++)
          Card(rank, suit)
    ];
    cards.shuffle();
    world.addAll(cards);

    int cardToDeal = cards.length - 1;
    for (var i = 0; i < 7; i++) {
      for (var j = i; j < 7; j++) {
        piles[j].acquireCard(cards[cardToDeal--]);
      }
      piles[i].flipTopCard();
    }
    for(int n = 0; n <= cardToDeal; n++) {
      stock.acquireCard(cards[n]);
    }
  }
```

Note how we deal the cards from the deck and place them into `TableauPile`s one by one, and only
after that we put the remaining cards into the stock.

Recall that we decided earlier that all the cards would be owned by the `KlondikeGame` itself. So
they are put into a generated List structure called `cards`, shuffled and added to the `world`. This
List should always have 52 cards in it, so a descending index `cardToDeal` is used to deal 28 cards
one by one from the top of the deck into piles that acquire references to the cards in the deck. An
ascending index is used to deal the remaining 24 cards into the stock in correct shuffled order. At
the end of the deal there are still 52 `Card` objects in the `cards` list. In the card piles we
used `removeList()` to retrieve a card from a pile, but not here because it would remove cards
from `KlondikeGame`'s ownership.

The `flipTopCard` method in the `TableauPile` class is as trivial as it sounds:

```dart
  void flipTopCard() {
    assert(_cards.last.isFaceDown);
    _cards.last.flip();
  }
```

If you run the game at this point, it would be nicely set up and look as if it was ready to play.
Except that we can't move the cards yet, which is kinda a deal-breaker here. So without further ado,
presenting you the next section:

## Moving the cards

Moving the cards is a somewhat more complicated topic than what we have had so far. We will split
it into several smaller steps:

1. Simple movement: grab a card and move it around.
2. Ensure that the user can only move the cards that they are allowed to.
3. Check that the cards are dropped at proper destinations.
4. Drag a run of cards.

### 1. Simple movement

So, we want to be able to drag the cards on the screen. This is even simpler than making the
`StockPile` tappable: just head over into the `Card` class and add the `DragCallbacks` mixin:

```dart
class Card extends PositionComponent with DragCallbacks {
}
```

The next step is to implement the actual drag event callbacks: `onDragStart`, `onDragUpdate`, and
`onDragEnd`.

When the drag gesture is initiated, the first thing that we need to do is to raise the priority of
the card, so that it is rendered above all others. Without this, the card would be occasionally
"sliding beneath" other cards, which would look most unnatural:

```dart
  @override
  void onDragStart(DragStartEvent event) {
    priority = 100;
  }
```

During the drag, the `onDragUpdate` event will be called continuously. Using this callback we will
be updating the position of the card so that it follows the movement of the finger (or the mouse).
The `event` object passed to this callback contains the most recent coordinate of the point of
touch, and also the `localDelta` property -- which is the displacement vector since the previous
call of `onDragUpdate`, considering the camera zoom.

```dart
  @override
  void onDragUpdate(DragUpdateEvent event) {
    position += event.localDelta;
  }
```

So far this allows you to grab any card and drag it anywhere around the table. What we want,
however, is to be able to restrict where the card is allowed or not allowed to go. This is where
the core of the logic of the game begins.

### 2. Move only allowed cards

The first restriction that we impose is that the user should only be able to drag the cards that we
allow, which include: (1) the top card of a waste pile, (2) the top card of a foundation pile, and
(3) any face-up card in a tableau pile.

Thus, in order to determine whether a card can be moved or not, we need to know which pile it
currently belongs to. There could be several ways that we go about it, but seemingly the most
straightforward is to let every card keep a reference to the pile in which it currently resides.

So, let's start by defining the abstract interface `Pile` that all our existing piles will be
implementing:

```dart
abstract class Pile {
  bool canMoveCard(Card card);
}
```

We will expand this class further later, but for now let's make sure that each of the classes
`StockPile`, `WastePile`, `FoundationPile`, and `TableauPile` are marked as implementing this
interface:

```dart
class StockPile extends PositionComponent with TapCallbacks implements Pile {
  ...
  @override
  bool canMoveCard(Card card) => false;
}

class WastePile extends PositionComponent implements Pile {
  ...
  @override
  bool canMoveCard(Card card) => _cards.isNotEmpty && card == _cards.last;
}

class FoundationPile extends PositionComponent implements Pile {
  ...
  @override
  bool canMoveCard(Card card) => _cards.isNotEmpty && card == _cards.last;
}

class TableauPile extends PositionComponent implements Pile {
  ...
  @override
  bool canMoveCard(Card card) => _cards.isNotEmpty && card == _cards.last;
}
```

We also wanted to let every `Card` know which pile it is currently in. For this, add the field
`Pile? pile` into the `Card` class, and make sure to set it in each pile's `acquireCard()` method,
like so:

```dart
  void acquireCard(Card card) {
    ...
    card.pile = this;
  }
```

Now we can put this new functionality to use: go into the `Card.onDragStart()` method and modify
it so that it would check whether the card is allowed to be moved before starting the drag:

```dart
  void onDragStart(DragStartEvent event) {
    if (pile?.canMoveCard(this) ?? false) {
      super.onDragStart(event);
      priority = 100;
    }
  }
```

We have also added a call to `super.onDragStart()` which sets an `_isDragged` variable to `true`
in the `DragCallbacks` mixin, we need to check this flag via the public `isDragged` getter in
the `onDragUpdate()` method and use `super.onDragEnd()` in `onDragEnd()` so the flag is set back
to `false`:

```dart
  @override
  void onDragUpdate(DragUpdateEvent event) {
    if (!isDragged) {
      return;
    }
    position += event.localDelta;
  }

  @override
  void onDragEnd(DragEndEvent event) {
    super.onDragEnd(event);
  }
```

Now only the proper cards can be dragged, but they still drop at random positions on the table,
so let's work on that.

### 3. Dropping the cards at proper locations

At this point what we want to do is to figure out where the dragged card is being dropped. More
specifically, we want to know into which _pile_ it is being dropped. This can be achieved by using
the `componentsAtPoint()` API, which allows you to query which components are located at a given
position on the screen.

Thus, my first attempt at revising the `onDragEnd` callback looks like this:

```dart
  @override
  void onDragEnd(DragEndEvent event) {
    if (!isDragged) {
      return;
    }
    super.onDragEnd(event);
    final dropPiles = parent!
        .componentsAtPoint(position + size / 2)
        .whereType<Pile>()
        .toList();
    if (dropPiles.isNotEmpty) {
      // if (card is allowed to be dropped into this pile) {
      //   remove the card from the current pile
      //   add the card into the new pile
      // }
    }
    // return the card to where it was originally
  }
```

This still contains several placeholders for the functionality that still needs to be implemented,
so let's get to it.

First piece of the puzzle is the "is card allowed to be dropped here?" check. To implement this,
first head over into the `Pile` class and add the `canAcceptCard()` abstract method:

```dart
abstract class Pile {
  ...
  bool canAcceptCard(Card card);
}
```

Obviously this now needs to be implemented for every `Pile` subclass, so let's get to it:

```dart
class FoundationPile ... implements Pile {
  ...
  @override
  bool canAcceptCard(Card card) {
    final topCardRank = _cards.isEmpty? 0 : _cards.last.rank.value;
    return card.suit == suit && card.rank.value == topCardRank + 1;
  }
}

class TableauPile ... implements Pile {
  ...
  @override
  bool canAcceptCard(Card card) {
    if (_cards.isEmpty) {
      return card.rank.value == 13;
    } else {
      final topCard = _cards.last;
      return card.suit.isRed == !topCard.suit.isRed &&
          card.rank.value == topCard.rank.value - 1;
    }
  }
}
```

(for the `StockPile` and the `WastePile` the method should just return false, since no cards should
be dropped there).

Alright, next part is the "remove the card from its current pile". Once again, let's head over to
the `Pile` class and add the `removeCard()` abstract method:

```dart
abstract class Pile {
  ...
  void removeCard(Card card);
}
```

Then we need to re-visit all four pile subclasses and implement this method:

```dart
class StockPile ... implements Pile {
  ...
  @override
  void removeCard(Card card) => throw StateError('cannot remove cards from here');
}

class WastePile ... implements Pile {
  ...
  @override
  void removeCard(Card card) {
    assert(canMoveCard(card));
    _cards.removeLast();
    _fanOutTopCards();
  }
}

class FoundationPile ... implements Pile {
  ...
  @override
  void removeCard(Card card) {
    assert(canMoveCard(card));
    _cards.removeLast();
  }
}

class TableauPile ... implements Pile {
  ...
  @override
  void removeCard(Card card) {
    assert(_cards.contains(card) && card.isFaceUp);
    final index = _cards.indexOf(card);
    _cards.removeRange(index, _cards.length);
    if (_cards.isNotEmpty && _cards.last.isFaceDown) {
      flipTopCard();
    }
  }
}
```

The next action in our pseudo-code is to "add the card to the new pile". But this one we have
already implemented: it's the `acquireCard()` method. So all we need is to declare it in the `Pile`
interface:

```dart
abstract class Pile {
  ...
  void acquireCard(Card card);
}
```

The last piece that's missing is "return the card to where it was". You can probably guess how we
are going to go about this one: add the `returnCard()` method into the `Pile` interface, and then
implement this method in all four pile subclasses:

```dart
class StockPile ... implements Pile {
  ...
  @override
  void returnCard(Card card) => throw StateError('cannot remove cards from here');
}

class WastePile ... implements Pile {
  ...
  @override
  void returnCard(Card card) {
    card.priority = _cards.indexOf(card);
    _fanOutTopCards();
  }
}

class FoundationPile ... implements Pile {
  ...
  @override
  void returnCard(Card card) {
    card.position = position;
    card.priority = _cards.indexOf(card);
  }
}

class TableauPile ... implements Pile {
  ...
  @override
  void returnCard(Card card) {
    final index = _cards.indexOf(card);
    card.position =
        index == 0 ? position : _cards[index - 1].position + _fanOffset;
    card.priority = index;
  }
}
```

Now, putting this all together, the `Card`'s `onDragEnd` method will look like this:

```dart
  @override
  void onDragEnd(DragEndEvent event) {
    if (!isDragged) {
      return;
    }
    super.onDragEnd(event);
    final dropPiles = parent!
        .componentsAtPoint(position + size / 2)
        .whereType<Pile>()
        .toList();
    if (dropPiles.isNotEmpty) {
      if (dropPiles.first.canAcceptCard(this)) {
        pile!.removeCard(this);
        dropPiles.first.acquireCard(this);
        return;
      }
    }
    pile!.returnCard(this);
  }
```

Ok, that was quite a lot of work -- but if you run the game now, you'd be able to move the cards
properly from one pile to another, and they will never go where they are not supposed to go. The
only thing that remains is to be able to move multiple cards at once between tableau piles. So take
a short break, and then on to the next section!

### 4. Moving a run of cards

In this section we will be implementing the necessary changes to allow us to move small stacks of
cards between the tableau piles. Before we begin, though, we need to make a small fix first.

You have probably noticed when running the game in the previous section that the cards in the
tableau piles clamp too closely together. That is, they are at the correct distance when they face
down, but they should be at a larger distance when they face up, which is not currently the case.
This makes it really difficult to see which cards are available for dragging.

So, let's head over into the `TableauPile` class and create a new method `layOutCards()`, whose job
would be to ensure that all cards currently in the pile have the right positions:

```dart
  final Vector2 _fanOffset1 = Vector2(0, KlondikeGame.cardHeight * 0.05);
  final Vector2 _fanOffset2 = Vector2(0, KlondikeGame.cardHeight * 0.20);

  void layOutCards() {
    if (_cards.isEmpty) {
      return;
    }
    _cards[0].position.setFrom(position);
    for (var i = 1; i < _cards.length; i++) {
      _cards[i].position
        ..setFrom(_cards[i - 1].position)
        ..add(_cards[i - 1].isFaceDown ? _fanOffset1 : _fanOffset2);
    }
  }
```

Make sure to call this method at the end of `removeCard()`, `returnCard()`, and `acquireCard()` --
replacing any current logic that handles card positioning.

Another problem that you may have noticed is that for taller card stacks it becomes hard to place a
card there. This is because our logic for determining in which pile the card is being dropped checks
whether the center of the card is inside any of the `TableauPile` components -- but those components
have only the size of a single card! To fix this inconsistency, all we need is to declare that the
height of the tableau pile is at least as tall as all the cards in it, or even higher. Add this line
at the end of the `layOutCards()` method:

```dart
    height = KlondikeGame.cardHeight * 1.5 + _cards.last.y - _cards.first.y;
```

The factor `1.5` here adds a little bit extra space at the bottom of each pile. The card to be
dropped should be overlapping the hitbox by a little over half its width and height. If you are
approaching from below, it would be just overlapping the nearest card (i.e. the one that is fully
visible). You can temporarily turn the debug mode on to see the hitboxes.

![Illustration of Tableau Pile Hitboxes](../../images/tutorials/klondike-tableau-hitboxes.png)

Ok, let's get to our main topic: how to move a stack of cards at once.

First thing that we're going to add is the list of `attachedCards` for every card. This list will
be non-empty only when the card is being dragged while having other cards on top. Add the following
declaration to the `Card` class:

```dart
  final List<Card> attachedCards = [];
```

Now, in order to create this list in `onDragStart`, we need to query the `TableauPile` for the list
of cards that are on top of the given card. Let's add such a method into the `TableauPile` class:

```dart
  List<Card> cardsOnTop(Card card) {
    assert(card.isFaceUp && _cards.contains(card));
    final index = _cards.indexOf(card);
    return _cards.getRange(index + 1, _cards.length).toList();
  }
```

While we are in the `TableauPile` class, let's also update the `canMoveCard()` method to allow
dragging cards that are not necessarily on top:

```dart
  @override
  bool canMoveCard(Card card) => card.isFaceUp;
```

Heading back into the `Card` class, we can use this method in order to populate the list of
`attachedCards` when the card starts to move:

```dart
  @override
  void onDragStart(DragStartEvent event) {
    if (pile?.canMoveCard(this) ?? false) {
      super.onDragStart();
      priority = 100;
      if (pile is TableauPile) {
        attachedCards.clear();
        final extraCards = (pile! as TableauPile).cardsOnTop(this);
        for (final card in extraCards) {
          card.priority = attachedCards.length + 101;
          attachedCards.add(card);
        }
      }
    }
  }
```

Now all we need to do is to make sure that the attached cards are also moved with the main card in
the `onDragUpdate` method:

```dart
  @override
  void onDragUpdate(DragUpdateEvent event) {
    if (!isDragged) {
      return;
    }
    final delta = event.localDelta;
    position.add(delta);
    attachedCards.forEach((card) => card.position.add(delta));
  }
```

This does the trick, almost. All that remains is to fix any loose ends. For example, we don't want
to let the user drop a stack of cards onto a foundation pile, so let's head over into the
`FoundationPile` class and modify the `canAcceptCard()` method accordingly:

```dart
  @override
  bool canAcceptCard(Card card) {
    final topCardRank = _cards.isEmpty ? 0 : _cards.last.rank.value;
    return card.suit == suit &&
        card.rank.value == topCardRank + 1 &&
        card.attachedCards.isEmpty;
  }
```

Secondly, we need to properly take care of the stack of card as it is being dropped into a tableau
pile. So, go back into the `Card` class and update its `onDragEnd()` method to also move the
attached cards into the pile, and the same when it comes to returning the cards into the old pile:

```dart
  @override
  void onDragEnd(DragEndEvent event) {
    if (!isDragged) {
      return;
    }
    super.onDragEnd(event);
    final dropPiles = parent!
        .componentsAtPoint(position + size / 2)
        .whereType<Pile>()
        .toList();
    if (dropPiles.isNotEmpty) {
      if (dropPiles.first.canAcceptCard(this)) {
        pile!.removeCard(this);
        dropPiles.first.acquireCard(this);
        if (attachedCards.isNotEmpty) {
          attachedCards.forEach((card) => dropPiles.first.acquireCard(card));
          attachedCards.clear();
        }
        return;
      }
    }
    pile!.returnCard(this);
    if (attachedCards.isNotEmpty) {
      attachedCards.forEach((card) => pile!.returnCard(card));
      attachedCards.clear();
    }
  }
```

Well, this is it! The game is now fully playable. Press the button below to see what the resulting
code looks like, or to play it live. In the next section we will discuss how to make it more

# 5. Animations, restarting, buttons and a New World

In this chapter we will be showing various ways to make the Klondike game more fun and easier to
play. The topics to be covered are:

- Klondike Draw 1 and Draw 3
- Animating and automating moves
- Detecting and celebrating a win
- Ending and restarting the game
- How to implement your own FlameGame world
- Simple action-buttons
- Anchors and co-ordinates
- Random number generation and seeding
- Effects and EffectControllers

## The Klondike draw

The Klondike patience game (or solitaire game in the USA) has two main variants: Draw 3 and Draw 1.
Currently the Klondike Flame Game is Draw 3, which is a lot more difficult than Draw 1, because
although you can see 3 cards, you can only move one of them and that move changes the "phase" of
other cards. So different cards are going to become available, not easy.

In Klondike Draw 1 just one card at a time is drawn from the Stock and shown, so every card in it is
available, and you can go through the Stock as many times as you like, just as in Klondike Draw 3.

So how do we implement Klondike Draw 1? Clearly only the Stock and Waste piles are involved, so
maybe we should have KlondikeGame provide a value 1 or 3 to each of them. They both have code for
constructors, so we could just add an extra parameter to that code, but in Flame there is another
way, which works even if your component has a default constructor (no code for it) or your game has
many game-wide values. Let us call our value `klondikeDraw`. In your class declaration add the
`HasGameReference<MyGame>` mixin, then write `game.klondikeDraw` wherever you need the value 1 or 3.
For class StockPile we will have:

```dart
class StockPile extends PositionComponent
    with TapCallbacks, HasGameReference<KlondikeGame>
    implements Pile {
```

and

```dart
  @override
  void onTapUp(TapUpEvent event) {
    final wastePile = parent!.firstChild<WastePile>()!;
    if (_cards.isEmpty) {
      wastePile.removeAllCards().reversed.forEach((card) {
        card.flip();
        acquireCard(card);
      });
    } else {
      for (var i = 0; i < game.klondikeDraw; i++) {
        if (_cards.isNotEmpty) {
          final card = _cards.removeLast();
          card.flip();
          wastePile.acquireCard(card);
        }
      }
    }
  }
```

For class WastePile we will have:

```dart
class WastePile extends PositionComponent
    with HasGameReference<KlondikeGame>
    implements Pile {
```

and

```dart
  void _fanOutTopCards() {
    if (game.klondikeDraw == 1) {   // No fan-out in Klondike Draw 1.
      return;
    }
    final n = _cards.length;
    for (var i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      _cards[i].position = position;
    }
    if (n == 2) {
      _cards[1].position.add(_fanOffset);
    } else if (n >= 3) {
      _cards[n - 2].position.add(_fanOffset);
      _cards[n - 1].position.addScaled(_fanOffset, 2);
    }
  }
```

That makes the Stock and Waste piles play either Klondike Draw 1 or Klondike Draw 3, but how do you
tell them which variant to play? For now, we will add a place-holder to the KlondikeGame class.
We just comment out whichever one we do not want and then rebuild.

```dart
  // final int klondikeDraw = 3;
  final int klondikeDraw = 1;
```

This is fine as a temporary measure, when we have not yet decided how to handle some aspect of
our design, but ultimately we will have to provide some kind of **input** for the player to choose
which flavor of Klondike to play, such as a menu screen, a settings screen or a button. Flame can
incorporate Flutter widgets into a game and the next Tutorial (Ember) shows how to add a menu
widget, as its final step.

## Making cards move

In Flame, if we need a component to do something, we use an `Effect` - a special component that can
attach to another component, such as a card, and modify its properties. That includes any kind of
motion (or change of `position`). We also need an `EffectController`, which provides timing for an
effect: when to start, how long to go for and what `Curve` to follow. The latter is not a curve in
space. It is a time-curve that specifies accelerations and decelerations during the time of the
effect, such as start moving a card quickly and then slow down as it approaches its destination.

To move a card, we will add a `doMove()` method to the `Card` class. It will require a `to` location
to go to. Optional parameters are `speed:` (default 10.0), `start:` (default zero),
`curve:` (default `Curves.easeOutQuad`) and `onComplete:` (default `null`, i.e. no callback when
the move finishes). Speed is in card widths per second. Usually we will provide a callback, because
a bit of gameplay must be done **after** the animated move. The default `curve:` parameter gives us
a fast-in/slow-out move, much as a human player would do. So the following code is added to the
end of the `Card` class:

```dart
  void doMove(
    Vector2 to, {
    double speed = 10.0,
    double start = 0.0,
    Curve curve = Curves.easeOutQuad,
    VoidCallback? onComplete,
  }) {
    assert(speed > 0.0, 'Speed must be > 0 widths per second');
    final dt = (to - position).length / (speed * size.x);
    assert(dt > 0.0, 'Distance to move must be > 0');
    priority = 100;
    add(
      MoveToEffect(
        to,
        EffectController(duration: dt, startDelay: start, curve: curve),
        onComplete: () {
          onComplete?.call();
        },
      ),
    );
  }
```

To make this code compile we need to import `'package:flame/effects.dart'` and
`'package:flutter/animation.dart'` at the top of the `components/card.dart` file. That done, we can
start using the new method to return the card(s) gracefully to where they came from, after being
dropped in an invalid position. First, we need a private data item to store a card's position when
a drag-and-drop started. So let us insert new lines in two places as shown below:

```dart
  bool _isDragging = false;
  Vector2 _whereCardStarted = Vector2(0, 0);

  final List<Card> attachedCards = [];
```

```dart
      _isDragging = true;
      priority = 100;
      // Copy each co-ord, else _whereCardStarted changes as the position does.
      _whereCardStarted = Vector2(position.x, position.y);
      if (pile is TableauPile) {
```

It would be a mistake to write `_whereCardStarted = position;` here. In Dart, that would just
copy a reference: so `_whereCardStarted` would point to the same data as `position` while the
drag occurred and the card's `position` data changed. We can get around this by copying the card's
**current** X and Y co-ordinates into a **new** `Vector2` object.

To animate cards being returned to their original piles after an invalid drag-and-drop, we replace
five lines at the end of the `onDragEnd()` method with:

```dart
    // Invalid drop (middle of nowhere, invalid pile or invalid card for pile).
    doMove(
      _whereCardStarted,
      onComplete: () {
        pile!.returnCard(this);
      },
    );
    if (attachedCards.isNotEmpty) {
      attachedCards.forEach((card) {
        final offset = card.position - position;
        card.doMove(
          _whereCardStarted + offset,
          onComplete: () {
            pile!.returnCard(card);
          },
        );
      });
      attachedCards.clear();
    }
```

In each case, we use the default speed of 10 card-widths per second.
Notice how the `onComplete:` parameters are used to return each card to the pile where it started.
It will then be added back to that pile's list of contents. Notice also that the list of attached
cards (if any) is cleared immediately, as the animated cards start to move. This does not matter,
because each moving card has a `MoveToEffect` and an `EffectController` added to it and these
contain all the data needed to get the right card to the right place at the right time. Thus
no important information is lost by clearing the attached cards early. Also, by default, the
`MoveToEffect` and `EffectController` in each moving card automatically get detached and deleted
by Flame when the show is over.

Some other automatic and animated moves we can try are dealing the cards, flipping cards from Stock
to Waste pile, turning cards over automatically on the tableau piles, and settling cards into place
after a valid drag-and-drop. We will have a look at animating a flip first.

## Animating a card-flip

Flutter and Flame do not yet support 3-D effects (as at October 2023), but we can emulate them.
To make a card look as if it is turning over, we will shrink the width of the back-view, switch
to the front view and expand back to full width. The code uses quite a few features of Effects
and EffectControllers:

```dart
  void turnFaceUp({
    double time = 0.3,
    double start = 0.0,
    VoidCallback? onComplete,
  }) {
    assert(!_isFaceUpView, 'Card must be face-down before turning face-up.');
    assert(time > 0.0, 'Time to turn card over must be > 0');
    _isAnimatedFlip = true;
    anchor = Anchor.topCenter;
    position += Vector2(width / 2, 0);
    priority = 100;
    add(
      ScaleEffect.to(
        Vector2(scale.x / 100, scale.y),
        EffectController(
          startDelay: start,
          curve: Curves.easeOutSine,
          duration: time / 2,
          onMax: () {
            _isFaceUpView = true;
          },
          reverseDuration: time / 2,
          onMin: () {
            _isAnimatedFlip = false;
            _faceUp = true;
            anchor = Anchor.topLeft;
            position -= Vector2(width / 2, 0);
          },
        ),
        onComplete: () {
          onComplete?.call();
        },
      ),
    );
  }
```

So how does all this work? We have a default time of 0.3 seconds for the flip to occur, a start time
and an optional callback on completion, as before. Now we add a ScaleEffect to the card,
which shrinks it almost to zero width, but leaves the height unchanged. However, that must take
only half the time, then we must switch from the face-down to the face-up view of the card and
expand it back out, also in half the time.

This is where we use some of the fancier parameters of the `EffectController` class. The
`duration:` is set to `time / 2` and we use an `onMax:` callback, with inline code to change the
view to face-up. That callback will happen after `time / 2`, when the `Effect` (whatever it is)
has reached its maximum (i.e. in this case, the view of the card has shrunk to a thin vertical
line). After the switch to face-up view, the EffectController will take the Effect into reverse
for `reverseDuration: time / 2`. Everything is reversed: the view of the card expands and the
`curve:` of time is applied in reverse order. In total, the timing follows a sine curve from
0 to pi, giving a smooth animation in which the width of the card-view is always the projection
into 2-D of its 3-D position. Wow! That's a lot of work for a little EffectController!

We are not there yet! If you were to run just the `add()` part of the code, you would see some
ugly things happening. Yeah, yeah, been there, done that... when I was preparing this code!
First off, the card shrinks to a line at its left. That is because all cards in this game have
an `Anchor` at `topLeft`, which is the point used to set the card's `position`. We would like
the card to flip around its vertical center-line. Easy, just set `anchor = Anchor.topCenter`
first: that makes the card flip realistically, but it jumps by half a card-width to the left
before flipping.

Long story short, see the lines between `assert(` and `add(` and their reversal in the `onMin:`
callback, which occurs when the Effect is finished, but before the final `onComplete:` callback.
At the beginning, the card's rendering `priority` is set to 100, so that it will ride above all
other cards in the neighborhood. That value cannot always be saved and restored because we may
not know what the card's priority should be in whatever `Pile` is receiving it. So we have made
sure that the receiver is always called in the `onComplete:` option, using a method that will
adjust the positions and priorities of the cards in the pile.

Last but not least, in the preceding code, notice the use of the variable `_isAnimatedFlip`.
This is a `bool` variable defined and initialized near the start of class `Card` in file
`components/card.dart`, along with another new `bool` called `_isFaceUpView`. Initially these
are set `false`, along with the existing `bool _faceUp = false` variable. What is the significance
of these variables? It is **huge**. A few lines further down, we see:

```dart
  @override
  void render(Canvas canvas) {
    if (_isFaceUpView) {
      _renderFront(canvas);
    } else {
      _renderBack(canvas);
    }
  }
```

This is the code that makes every card visible on the screen, in either face-up or face-down state.
At the end of Klondike Tutorial Step 4, the `if` statement was `if (_faceUp) {`. This was OK
because all moves of cards were instantaneous (leaving aside drags and drops): any change in the
card's face-up or face-down state could be rendered at the Flame Engine's next `tick` or soon after.
This posed no problem when we started to animate card moves, provided there were no flips involved.
However, when we tapped a non-empty Stock Pile, the executed code was:

```dart
  final card = _cards.removeLast();
  card.flip;
  wastePile.acquireCard(card);
```

And the first thing `wastePile.acquireCard(` does is `assert(card.isFaceUp);`, which fails if an
animated flip is keeping the card face-down while the first half of the flip is occurring.

## Model and View

Clearly the card cannot be in two states at once: it is not Schrödinger's cat! We can resolve the
dilemma by using two definitions of "face-up": a Model type and a View type. The View version is
used in rendering and animation (i.e. what appears on the screen) and the Model version in the logic
of the game, the gameplay and its error-checks. That way, we do not have to revise all the logic
of the Piles in this game in order to animate some of it. A more complex game might benefit from
separating the Model and the View during the design and early coding stages, even into
separate classes. In this game we are using just a little separation of Model and View. The
`_isAnimatedFlip` variable is `true` while there is an animated flip going on, otherwise `false`,
and the `Card` class's `flip()` function is expanded to:

```dart
  void flip() {
    if (_isAnimatedFlip) {
      // Let the animation determine the FaceUp/FaceDown state.
      _faceUp = _isFaceUpView;
    } else {
      // No animation: flip and render the card immediately.
      _faceUp = !_faceUp;
      _isFaceUpView = _faceUp;
    }
  }
```

In the Klondike Tutorial game we are still having to trigger a Model update in the `onComplete:`
callback of the flip animation. It might be nice, for impatient or rapid-fingered players, to
transfer a card from Stock Pile to Waste Pile instantaneously, in the Model, leaving the animation
in the View to catch up later, with no `onComplete:` callback. That way, you could flip through
the Stock Pile very rapidly, by tapping fast. However, that is beyond the scope of this Tutorial.

## Ending and restarting the game

As it stands, there is no easy way to finish the Klondike Tutorial game and start another, even if
you have won. We can only close the app and start it again. And there is no "reward" for winning.

There are various ways to tackle this, depending on the simplicity or complexity of your game and
on how long the `onLoad()` method is likely to take. They can range from writing your own
GameWidget, to doing a few simple re-initializations in your Game class (i.e. KlondikeGame in this
case).

In the GameWidget case you would supply the Game with a VoidCallback function parameter named
`reset` or `restart`. When the callback is invoked, it would use the Flutter conventions of a
`StatefulWidget` (e.g. `setState(() {});)` to force the widget to be rebuilt and replaced, thus
releasing all references to the current Game instance, its state and all of its memory. There could
also be Flutter code to run a menu or other startup screen.

Re-initialization should be undertaken only if the operations involved are few and simple. Otherwise
coding errors could lead to subtle problems, memory leaks and crashes in your game. It might be the
easiest way to go in Klondike (as it is in the Ember Tutorial). Basically, we must clear all the
card references out of all the `Pile`s and then re-shuffle (or not) and re-deal, possibly changing
from Klondike Draw 3 to Klondike Draw 1 or vice-versa.

Well, that was not as easy as it looked! Re-initializing the `Pile`s and each `Card` was easy
enough, but the difficult bit came next... Whether the player wins or restarts without winning, we
have 52 cards spread around various piles on the screen, some face-up and maybe some face-down. We
would like to animate the deal later, so it would be nice to collect the cards into a neat face-down
pile at top left, in the Stock Pile area: not the actual Stock Pile yet, because that gets created
during the deal.

Writing a simple little loop to set each `Card` face-down and use its `doMove` method to make it
move independently to the top left fails. It causes one of those "subtle problems" referred to
earlier. The cards all travel at the same speed but arrive at different times. The deal then
produces messy Tableau Piles with several cards out of position. Also the animated move of all
the cards to the Stock Pile area was a bit ugly.

The problem of the messy Tableau Piles was fixable, but at this point the reviewer of the code
and documentation proposed a completely new approach which avoids re-initializing anything and
creates all the Components from scratch, which is the preferred Flutter/Flame way of doing things.

## A New World

### Start and restart actions

We wish to provide the following actions in the Klondike game:

- A first start,
- Any number of restarts with a new deal,
- Any number of restarts with the same deal as before,
- A switch between Klondike Draw 1 and Draw 3 and restart with a new deal, and
- Have fun before restarting with a new deal (we'll keep that as a surprise for later).

The proposal is to have a new KlondikeWorld class, which replaces the default `world` provided by
FlameGame. The new world contains (almost) everything we need to play the game and is created or
re-created during each of the above actions.

### A stripped-down KlondikeGame class

Here is the new code for the KlondikeGame class (what is left of it).

```dart
enum Action { newDeal, sameDeal, changeDraw, haveFun }

class KlondikeGame extends FlameGame<KlondikeWorld> {
  static const double cardGap = 175.0;
  static const double topGap = 500.0;
  static const double cardWidth = 1000.0;
  static const double cardHeight = 1400.0;
  static const double cardRadius = 100.0;
  static const double cardSpaceWidth = cardWidth + cardGap;
  static const double cardSpaceHeight = cardHeight + cardGap;
  static final Vector2 cardSize = Vector2(cardWidth, cardHeight);
  static final cardRRect = RRect.fromRectAndRadius(
    const Rect.fromLTWH(0, 0, cardWidth, cardHeight),
    const Radius.circular(cardRadius),
  );

  // Constant used when creating Random seed.
  static const int maxInt = 0xFFFFFFFE; // = (2 to the power 32) - 1

  // This KlondikeGame constructor also initiates the first KlondikeWorld.
  KlondikeGame() : super(world: KlondikeWorld());

  // These three values persist between games and are starting conditions
  // for the next game to be played in KlondikeWorld. The actual seed is
  // computed in KlondikeWorld but is held here in case the player chooses
  // to replay a game by selecting Action.sameDeal.
  int klondikeDraw = 1;
  int seed = 1;
  Action action = Action.newDeal;
}
```

Huh! What happened to the `onLoad()` method? And what's this `seed` thing? And how does
KlondikeWorld get into the act? Well, everything that used to be in the `onLoad()` method is now
in the `onLoad()` method of KlondikeWorld, which is an extension of the `World` class and is a type
of `Component`, so it can have an `onLoad()` method, as can any `Component` type. The content of
the method is much the same as before, except that `world.add(` becomes just `add(`. It also brings
in some `addButton()` references, but more on these later.

### Using a Random Number Generator seed

The `seed` is a common games-programming technique in any programming environment. Usually it allows
you to start a Random Number Generator from a known point (called the seed) and give your game
reproducible behavior when you are in the development and testing stage. Here it is used to
provide exactly the same deal of the Klondike cards when the player requests `Same deal`.

### Introducing the new KlondikeWorld class

The `class KlondikeGame` declaration specifies that this extension of the FlameGame class must
have a world of type KlondikeWorld (i.e. `FlameGame<KlondikeWorld>`). Didn't know we could do
that for a game, did we? So how does the first instance of KlondikeWorld get created? It's all in
the KlondikeGame constructor code:

```dart
  KlondikeGame() : super(world: KlondikeWorld());
```

The constructor itself is a default constructor, but the colon `:` begins a constructor
initialization sequence which creates our world for the first time.

### Buttons

We are going to use some buttons to activate the various ways of restarting the Klondike Game. First
we extend Flame's `ButtonComponent` to create class `FlatButton`, adapted from a Flat Button which
used to be in Flame's Examples pages. `ButtonComponent` uses two `PositionComponent`s, one for when
the button is in its normal state (up) and one for when it is pressed. The two components are
`mounted` and `rendered` alternately as the user presses the button and releases it. To press the
button, tap and hold it down.

In our button, the two components are the button's outlines - the `buttonDown:` one makes
the outline of the button turn red when it is pressed, as a warning, because the four button-actions
all end the current game and start another. That is also why they are positioned at the top of the
canvas, above all the cards, where you are less likely to press them accidentally. If you do press
one and have second thoughts, keep pressing and slide away, then the button will have no effect.

The four buttons trigger the restart actions described above and are labelled `New deal`,
`Same deal`, `Draw 1 ⇌ 3` and `Have fun`. Flame also has a `SpriteButtonComponent`, based on two
alternating `Sprite`s, a `HudButtonComponent` and an `AdvancedButtonComponent`. For further types
of buttons and controllers, it would be best to use a Flutter overlay, menu or settings widget and
have access to Flutter's widgets for radio buttons, dropdown lists, sliders, etc. For the purposes
of this Tutorial our FlatButton will do fine.

We use the `addButton()` method, during our world's `onLoad()`, to set up our four buttons and
add them to our `world`.

```dart
    playAreaSize =
        Vector2(7 * cardSpaceWidth + cardGap, 4 * cardSpaceHeight + topGap);
    final gameMidX = playAreaSize.x / 2;

    addButton('New deal', gameMidX, Action.newDeal);
    addButton('Same deal', gameMidX + cardSpaceWidth, Action.sameDeal);
    addButton('Draw 1 or 3', gameMidX + 2 * cardSpaceWidth, Action.changeDraw);
    addButton('Have fun', gameMidX + 3 * cardSpaceWidth, Action.haveFun);
```

That places them above our four Foundation piles and centrally aligned with them. The first
Foundation pile happens to be aligned around the top-center of the screen, so the first button
is centred above it.

### Anchors and co-ordinates

The expressions here and in the `addButton()` method may seem odd because the cards and piles all
have `Anchor.topLeft` but the buttons have `Anchor.center`. The `position` co-ordinates of a `Card`
are where its top-left corner goes, but the `position` co-ordinates of a `FlatButton` are where its
_center_ goes and the various parts of a `FlatButton` are arranged (internally) around its center.
These examples can give us some insight into how co-ordinate systems work in Flame.

### The `deal()` method

The last thing the KlondikeWorld's `onLoad()` method does is call the `deal()` method to shuffle
and deal the cards. This method is now in the KlondikeWorld class and so are the `checkWin()` and
`letsCelebrate()` methods, but more about those later. The deal process is the same as before but
now includes some animation:

```dart
  void deal() {
    assert(cards.length == 52, 'There are ${cards.length} cards: should be 52');

    if (game.action != Action.sameDeal) {
      // New deal: change the Random Number Generator's seed.
      game.seed = Random().nextInt(KlondikeGame.maxInt);
      if (game.action == Action.changeDraw) {
        game.klondikeDraw = (game.klondikeDraw == 3) ? 1 : 3;
      }
    }
    // For the "Same deal" option, re-use the previous seed, else use a new one.
    cards.shuffle(Random(game.seed));

    var cardToDeal = cards.length - 1;
    var nMovingCards = 0;
    for (var i = 0; i < 7; i++) {
      for (var j = i; j < 7; j++) {
        final card = cards[cardToDeal--];
        card.doMove(
          tableauPiles[j].position,
          start: nMovingCards * 0.15,
          onComplete: () {
            tableauPiles[j].acquireCard(card);
            nMovingCards--;
            if (nMovingCards == 0) {
              var delayFactor = 0;
              for (final tableauPile in tableauPiles) {
                delayFactor++;
                tableauPile.flipTopCard(start: delayFactor * 0.15);
              }
            }
          },
        );
        nMovingCards++;
      }
    }
    for (var n = 0; n <= cardToDeal; n++) {
      stock.acquireCard(cards[n]);
    }
  }
```

First we implement the `Action` value for this game. In the very first game, the KlondikeGame class
sets defaults of `Action.newDeal` and `klondikeDraw = 1`, but after that the player can select an
action by pressing and releasing a button and KlondikeWorld saves it in KlondikeGame, or the player
wins the game, in which case `Action.newDeal` is selected and saved automatically. The action
usually generates and saves a new seed, but that is skipped if we have `Action.sameDeal`. Then we
shuffle the cards, using whatever `seed` applies.

The deal logic is the same as we used in Klondike Tutorial Step 4 and the animation is fairly easy.
We just use `card.doMove(` for each card, with a changing destination and an increasing `start:`
value, counting each moving card as it departs. For a few milliseconds after the loops terminate
`nMovingCards` will be at a maximum of 28 (i.e. 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7) and the remaining 24
cards will go into a properly constructed Stock Pile.

Then cards will be arriving over the next second or so and a problem arises. The cards do not
necessarily arrive in the order they are sent from the Stock Pile area. If we start turning over
the last cards in the columns too soon, we might turn over the wrong card and mess up the deal. The
following printout of the deal shows how arrivals can get out of order. The `j` variable is the
Tableau Pile number and `i` is the card's position in the pile. The King of Hearts for Pile 6 is
arriving before the Queen of Clubs that is the last card in Pile 5. And there are two more cards
to go in Pile 6.

```console
flutter: Move done, i 3, j 6, 6♠ 5 moving cards.
flutter: Move done, i 4, j 5, 9♥ 4 moving cards.
flutter: Move done, i 4, j 6, K♥ 3 moving cards.
flutter: Move done, i 5, j 5, Q♣ 2 moving cards.
flutter: Move done, i 5, j 6, 2♠ 1 moving cards.
flutter: Move done, i 6, j 6, 10♠ 0 moving cards.
flutter: Pile 0 [Q♦]
flutter: Pile 1 [J♣, Q♥]
flutter: Pile 2 [5♥, 5♦, J♦]
flutter: Pile 3 [A♠, Q♠, A♥, 5♠]
flutter: Pile 4 [8♦, 10♣, 7♥, 3♥, 4♥]
flutter: Pile 5 [4♠, 8♣, 5♣, 2♥, 9♥, Q♣]
flutter: Pile 6 [4♣, 3♦, K♦, 6♠, K♥, 2♠, 10♠]
```

So we count off the cards in the `onComplete()` callback code as they arrive. Only when all 28 cards
have arrived do we start turning over the last card of each Tableau Pile. When the deal has been
completed our KlondikeWorld is also complete and ready for play.

## More animations of moves

The `Card` class's `doMove()` and `turnFaceUp()` methods have been combined into a doMoveAndFlip()
method, which is used to draw cards from the Stock Pile. The dropping of a card or cards onto a pile
after drag-and-drop also uses `doMove()` to settle the drop more gracefully. Finally, there is a
shortcut to auto-move a card onto its Foundation Pile if it is ready to go out. This adds
`TapCallbacks` to the `Card` class and an `onTapUp()` callback as follows:

```dart
  onTapUp(TapUpEvent event) {
    if (isFaceUp) {
      final suitIndex = suit.value;
      if (game.foundations[suitIndex].canAcceptCard(this)) {
        pile!.removeCard(this);
        doMove(
          game.foundations[suitIndex].position,
          onComplete: () {
            game.foundations[suitIndex].acquireCard(this);
          },
        );
      }
    } else if (pile is StockPile) {
      game.stock.onTapUp(event);
    }
  }
```

If a card is ready to go out, just tap on it and it will move automatically to the correct
Foundation Pile for its suit. This saves a load of dragging-and-dropping when you are close to
winning the game! There is nothing new in the above code, except that if you tap the top card of
the Stock Pile, the `Card` object receives the tap first and forwards it on to the `stock` object.

## A graphics glitch

If you moved multiple cards from one Tableau Pile to another, the internal code of the `TableauPile`
class would formerly (in Tutorial Step 4) move the cards into place abruptly, as soon as the
drag-and-drop ended. In the new code (Step 5), drags and drops use essentially the same code as
before, so it is tempting to get that code to do a multi-card move as a series of animated moves
each completing with an `acquireCard` call. But this caused some ugly graphics glitches. It
appears they were due to `acquireCard` also calling the `layoutCards()` method of `TableauPile` and
instantly re-arranging all the cards in the pile, every time a card was acquired. The problem has
been solved (with some difficulty as it turned out), by adding a `dropCards` method to
`TableauPile`, which mimics some of the existing actions while dovetailing some card animations
in as well.

The lesson to be learned is that it is worth giving some attention to animation and time-dependent
concerns at Game Design time. When was that? Back in Klondike Tutorial Step 1 Preparation and
Step 2 Scaffolding.

## Winning the game

You win the game when all cards in all suits, Ace to King, have been moved to the Foundation Piles,
13 cards in each pile. The game now has code to recognize that event: an `isFull` test added to
the `FoundationPile`'s `acquireCard()` method, a callback to `KlondikeWorld` and a test as
to whether all four Foundations are full. Here is the code:

```dart
class FoundationPile extends PositionComponent implements Pile {
  FoundationPile(int intSuit, this.checkWin, {super.position})
      : suit = Suit.fromInt(intSuit),
        super(size: KlondikeGame.cardSize);

  final VoidCallback checkWin;

  final Suit suit;
  final List<Card> _cards = [];

  //#region Pile API

  bool get isFull => _cards.length == 13;
```

```dart
  void acquireCard(Card card) {
    assert(card.isFaceUp);
    card.position = position;
    card.priority = _cards.length;
    card.pile = this;
    _cards.add(card);
    if (isFull) {
      checkWin(); // Get KlondikeWorld to check all FoundationPiles.
    }
  }
```

```dart
  void checkWin()
  {
    var nComplete = 0;
    for (final f in foundations) {
      if (f.isFull) {
        nComplete++;
      }
    }
    if (nComplete == foundations.length) {
      letsCelebrate();
    }
  }
```

It is often possible to calculate whether you can win from a given position of the cards in a
Klondike game, or could have won but missed a vital move. It is frequently possible to calculate
whether the initial deal is winnable: a percentage of Klondike deals are not. But all that is far
beyond the scope of this Tutorial, so for now it is up to the player to work out whether to keep
playing and try to win, or give up and press one of the buttons.

## Ending a game and re-starting it

A game ends either after the player wins or they press and release one of the buttons. At that
point the KlondikeGame class must hold all the data needed to start a new game, namely an `Action`
value, a `klondikeDraw` value (1 or 3) and a `seed` from the previous game. Each button has an
`onReleased:` callback provided by the `addButton()` method in KlondikeWorld, with code as follows:

```dart
      onReleased: () {
        if (action == Action.haveFun) {
          // Shortcut to the "win" sequence, for Tutorial purposes only.
          letsCelebrate();
        } else {
          // Restart with a new deal or the same deal as before.
          game.action = action;
          game.world = KlondikeWorld();
        }
      },
```

The `letsCelebrate()` method is normally invoked only when the player wins. The functions of the
other three buttons are to set the `Action` value in KlondikeGame and to set `world` in `FlameGame`
to refer to a new KlondikeWorld, thus replacing the current one and leaving the former
KlondikeWorld's storage to be disposed of by Garbage Collect. `FlameGame` will continue on to
trigger KlondikeWorld's `onLoad()` method.

The `letsCelebrate()` method ends with similar code, but forces a new deal:

```dart
              game.action = Action.newDeal;
              game.world = KlondikeWorld();
```

## The `Have fun` button

When you win the Klondike Game, the `letsCelebrate()` method puts on a little display. To save you
having to play and win a whole game before you see it (**and** to test the method), we have
provided the `Have fun` button. Of course a real game could not have such a button...

Well, this is it! The game is now more playable.

We could do more, but this game **is** a Tutorial above all else. Press the buttons below to see
what the final code looks like, or to play it live.

But it is also time to have a look at the Ember Tutorial!

# Ember Quest Game Tutorial

In this tutorial, we will follow a step-by-step process for coding a game using the Flame
engine.

This tutorial assumes that you have at least some familiarity with common programming concepts, and
with the [Dart] programming language.

# 1. Preparation

Before you begin any kind of game project, you need an idea of what you want to make and I like to
then give it a **name**. For this tutorial and game, Ember will be on a quest to gather as many
(GitHub) stars as possible and I will call the game, `Ember Quest`.

Now it is time to get started, but first you need to go to the [bare flame game
tutorial](../bare_flame_game.md) and complete the necessary setup steps. When you come back, you
should already have the `main.dart` file with the following content:

```dart
import 'package:flame/game.dart';
import 'package:flutter/widgets.dart';

void main() {
  final game = FlameGame();
  runApp(GameWidget(game: game));
}
```

## Planning

Like in the [klondike](../klondike/klondike.md) tutorial, starting a new game can feel overwhelming.
I like to first decide what platform I am trying to target. Will this be a mobile game, a desktop
game, or maybe a web game, with Flutter and Flame, these are all possible. For this game though, I
am going to focus on a web game. This means my users will interact with the game using their
keyboards.

Starting with a simple sketch (it doesn't have to be perfect as mine is very rough) is
the best way to get an understanding of what will need to be accomplished. For the sketch below,
we know we will need the following:

- Player Class
- Enemy Class
- Star Class
- Platform Class
- Ground Class
- HUD Class (health and stars collected)

![Sketch of Ember Quest](../../images/tutorials/platformer/ember_quest_sketch.png)

All of these will be brought together in `EmberQuestGame` derived from `FlameGame`.

## Assets

Every game needs assets. Assets are images, sprites, animations, sounds, etc. Now, I am not an
artist, but because I am basing this game on Ember, the flame mascot, and Ember is already designed,
it sets the tone that this will be a pixel art game. There are numerous sites available that
provide free pixel art that can be used in games, but please check and comply with the licensing and
always provide valid creator attribution. For this game though, I am going to take a chance and
make my artwork using an online pixel art tool. If you decide to use this tool, multiple online
tutorials will assist you with the basic operations as well as exporting the assets. Now normally,
most games will utilize sprite sheets. These combine many images into one larger image that can be
sectioned and used as individual images. For this tutorial though, I specifically will save the
images individually as I want to demonstrate the Flame engine's caching abilities. Ember and the
water enemy are sprite sheets though as they contain multiple images to create animations.

Right-click the images below, choose "Save as...", and store them in the `assets/images` folder of the
project. At this point our project's structure looks like this:

```text
emberquest/
 ├─assets/
 │  └─images/
 │     ├─block.png
 │     ├─ember.png
 │     ├─ground.png
 │     ├─heart_half.png
 │     ├─heart.png
 │     ├─star.png
 │     └─water_enemy.png
 ├─lib/
 │  └─main.dart
 └─pubspec.yaml
```

![Platform Block](app/assets/images/block.png)
![Ember Animation](app/assets/images/ember.png)
![Ground Block](app/assets/images/ground.png)
![HUD Heart Half Opacity](app/assets/images/heart_half.png)
![HUD Heart Full Opacity](app/assets/images/heart.png)
![Star](app/assets/images/star.png)
![Water Enemy Animation](app/assets/images/water_enemy.png)

```{note}
You may ask, why are the images different sizes?

As I was using the online tool to make the assets, I had trouble getting the
detail I desired for the game in a 16x16 block. The heart worked out in 32x32
and the ground as well as the star were 64x64. Regardless, the asset size does
not matter for the game as we will resize as needed.
```

Also, you need to tell Flutter about these images (just having them inside the `assets` folder is
not enough). To do this, let's add the following lines into the `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
flutter:
  assets:
    - assets/images/
```

Alright, enough with preparing -- onward to coding!

## File: tutorials/platformer/step_2.md

# 2. Start Coding

## The Plan

Now that we have the assets loaded and a very rough idea of what classes we will need, we need to
start thinking about how we will implement this game and our goals. To do this, let's break down
what the game should do:

- Ember should be able to be controlled to move left, right, and jump.
- The level will be infinite, so we need a way to randomly load sections of the level.
- The objective is to collect stars while avoiding enemies.
- Enemies cannot be killed as you need to use the platforms to avoid them.
- If Ember is hit by an enemy, it should reduce Ember's health by 1.
- Ember should have 3 lives to lose.
- There should be pits that if Ember falls into, it is automatically game over.
- There should be a main menu and a game-over screen that lets the player start over.

Now that this is planned out, I know you are probably as excited as I am to begin and I just want to
see Ember on the screen. So let's do that first.

```{note}
Why did I choose to make this game an infinite side scrolling platformer?

Well, I wanted to be able to showcase random level loading. No two game plays
will be the same. This exact setup can easily be adapted to be a traditional
level game. As you make your way through this tutorial, you will see how we
could modify the level code to have an end. I will add a note in that section
to explain the appropriate mechanics.
```

## Loading Assets

For Ember to be displayed, we will need to load the assets. This can be done in `main.dart`, but by
so doing, we will quickly clutter the file. To keep our game organized, we should create files that
have a single focus. So let's create a file in the `lib` folder called `ember_quest.dart`. In that
file, we will add:

```dart
import 'package:flame/game.dart';

class EmberQuestGame extends FlameGame {
  EmberQuestGame();

  @override
  Future<void> onLoad() async {
    await images.loadAll([
      'block.png',
      'ember.png',
      'ground.png',
      'heart_half.png',
      'heart.png',
      'star.png',
      'water_enemy.png',
    ]);

  }
}
```

As I mentioned in the [assets](step_1.md#assets) section, we are using multiple individual image
files and for performance reasons, we should leverage Flame's built-in caching system which will
only load the files once, but allow us to access them as many times as needed without an impact to
the game. `await images.loadAll()` takes a list of the file names that are found in `assets/images`
and loads them to cache.

## Scaffolding

So now that we have our game file, let's prepare the `main.dart` file to receive our newly created
`FlameGame`. Change your entire `main.dart` file to the following:

```dart
import 'package:flame/game.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

import 'ember_quest.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(
    const GameWidget<EmberQuestGame>.controlled(
      gameFactory: EmberQuestGame.new,
    ),
  );
}
```

You can run this file and you should just have a blank screen now. Let's get Ember loaded!

## CameraComponent and World

To move around in the world we are going the use the built-in `CameraComponent` and `World` that
exists on the `FlameGame` class.
We are going to add all our components to the `world` and follow the player with the `camera`.

```dart
import 'package:flame/components.dart';
import 'package:flame/game.dart';

class EmberQuestGame extends FlameGame {
  @override
  Future<void> onLoad() async {
    await images.loadAll([
      'block.png',
      'ember.png',
      'ground.png',
      'heart_half.png',
      'heart.png',
      'star.png',
      'water_enemy.png',
    ]);

    // Everything in this tutorial assumes that the position
    // of the `CameraComponent`s viewfinder (where the camera is looking)
    // is in the top left corner, that's why we set the anchor here.
    camera.viewfinder.anchor = Anchor.topLeft;
  }
}
```

## Ember Time

Keeping your game files organized can always be a challenge. I like to keep things logically
organized by how they will be involved in my game. So for Ember, let's create the following folder,
`lib/actors` and in that folder, create `ember.dart`. In that file, add the following code:

```dart
import 'package:flame/components.dart';

import '../ember_quest.dart';

class EmberPlayer extends SpriteAnimationComponent
    with HasGameReference<EmberQuestGame> {
  EmberPlayer({
    required super.position,
  }) : super(size: Vector2.all(64), anchor: Anchor.center);

  @override
  void onLoad() {
    animation = SpriteAnimation.fromFrameData(
      game.images.fromCache('ember.png'),
      SpriteAnimationData.sequenced(
        amount: 4,
        textureSize: Vector2.all(16),
        stepTime: 0.12,
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This file uses the `HasGameRef` mixin which allows us to reach back to `ember_quest.dart` and
leverage any of the variables or methods that are defined in the game class. You can see this in
use with the line `game.images.fromCache('ember.png')`. Earlier, we loaded all the files into
cache, so to use that file now, we call `fromCache` so it can be leveraged by the `SpriteAnimation`.
The `EmberPlayer` class is extending a `SpriteAnimationComponent` which allows us to define
animation as well as position it accordingly in our game world. When we construct this class, the
default size of `Vector2.all(64)` is defined as the size of Ember in our game world should be 64x64.
You may notice that in the animation `SpriteAnimationData`, the `textureSize` is defined as
`Vector2.all(16)` or 16x16. This is because the individual frame in our `ember.png` is 16x16 and
there are 4 frames in total. To define the speed of the animation, `stepTime` is used and set at
`0.12` seconds per frame. You can change the `stepTime` to any length that makes the animation seem
correct for your game vision.

Now before you rush to run the game again, we have to add Ember to the game world. To do this, go
back to `ember_quest.dart` and add the following:

```dart
import 'package:flame/game.dart';

import 'actors/ember.dart';

class EmberQuestGame extends FlameGame {
  late EmberPlayer _ember;

  @override
  Future<void> onLoad() async {
    await images.loadAll([
      'block.png',
      'ember.png',
      'ground.png',
      'heart_half.png',
      'heart.png',
      'star.png',
      'water_enemy.png',
    ]);

    camera.viewfinder.anchor = Anchor.topLeft;

    _ember = EmberPlayer(
      position: Vector2(128, canvasSize.y - 70),
    );
    world.add(_ember);
  }
}
```

Run your game now and you should now see Ember flickering in the lower left-hand corner.

## Building Blocks

Now that we have Ember showing on screen and we know our basic environment is all working correctly,
it's time to create a world for Embers Quest! Proceed on to [](step_3.md)!

# 3. Building the World

## Creating Segments

For this world to be infinite, the best way to approach this is to create segments that can be
reloaded over and over. To do this, we need a rough sketch of what our level segments will look
like. I have created the following sketch to show what the segments would look like and how they can
be repeated:

![Level Segment Sketch](../../images/tutorials/platformer/LevelSegmentSketch.jpg)

Each segment is a 10x10 grid and each block is 64 pixels x 64 pixels. This means Ember Quest has a
height of 640 with an infinite width. In my design, there must always be a ground
block at the beginning and the end. Additionally, there must be at least 3 ground blocks that come
before an enemy, including if the segment wraps to another segment. This is because the plan is to
have the enemies traverse back and forth for 3 blocks. Now that we have a plan for the segments,
let's create a segment manager class.

### Segment Manager

To get started, we have to understand that we will be referencing our blocks in the segment manager,
so first create a new folder called `lib/objects`. In that folder, create 3 files called
`ground_block.dart`, `platform_block.dart`, and `star.dart`. Those files just need basic
boilerplate code for the class, so create the following in their respective files:

```dart
class GroundBlock {}

class PlatformBlock {}

class Star {}
```

Also, create `water_enemy.dart` in the `lib/actors` folder using this boilerplate code:

```dart
class WaterEnemy {}
```

Now we can create a file called `segment_manager.dart` which will be placed in a new folder called
`lib/managers`. The segment manager is the heart and soul, if you will, of Ember Quest. This is
where you can get as creative as you want. You do not have to follow my design, just remember that
whatever you design, the segment must follow the rules outlined above. Add the following code to
`segment_manager.dart`:

```dart
class Block {
  // gridPosition position is always segment based X,Y.
  // 0,0 is the bottom left corner.
  // 10,10 is the upper right corner.
  final Vector2 gridPosition;
  final Type blockType;
  Block(this.gridPosition, this.blockType);
}

final segments = [
  segment0,
];

final segment0 = [

];
```

So what this does, is allows us to create segments (segment0, segment1, etc) in a list format that
gets added to the `segments` list. The individual segments will be made up of multiple entries of the
`Block` class. This information will allow us to translate the block position from a 10x10 grid to
the actual pixel position in the game world. To create a segment, you need to create
entries for each block that you wish to be rendered from the sketch.

To understand each segment, if we start in the bottom left corner of the grid in the sketch, we see
that we should place a `Block()` in the `segment0` list with a first parameter `gridPosition` of a
`Vector2(0,0)` and a `blockType` of the `GroundBlock` class that we created earlier. Remember, the
very bottom left cell is x=0 and y=0 thus the `Vector2(x,y)` is `Vector2(0,0)`.

![Segment 0 Sketch](../../images/tutorials/platformer/Segment0Sketch.jpg)

The full segment would look like this:

```dart
final segment0 = [
  Block(Vector2(0, 0), GroundBlock),
  Block(Vector2(1, 0), GroundBlock),
  Block(Vector2(2, 0), GroundBlock),
  Block(Vector2(3, 0), GroundBlock),
  Block(Vector2(4, 0), GroundBlock),
  Block(Vector2(5, 0), GroundBlock),
  Block(Vector2(5, 1), WaterEnemy),
  Block(Vector2(5, 3), PlatformBlock),
  Block(Vector2(6, 0), GroundBlock),
  Block(Vector2(6, 3), PlatformBlock),
  Block(Vector2(7, 0), GroundBlock),
  Block(Vector2(7, 3), PlatformBlock),
  Block(Vector2(8, 0), GroundBlock),
  Block(Vector2(8, 3), PlatformBlock),
  Block(Vector2(9, 0), GroundBlock),
];
```

Proceed to build the remaining segments. The full segment manager should look like this:

```dart
import 'package:flame/components.dart';

import '../actors/water_enemy.dart';
import '../objects/ground_block.dart';
import '../objects/platform_block.dart';
import '../objects/star.dart';

class Block {
  // gridPosition position is always segment based X,Y.
  // 0,0 is the bottom left corner.
  // 10,10 is the upper right corner.
  final Vector2 gridPosition;
  final Type blockType;
  Block(this.gridPosition, this.blockType);
}

final segments = [
  segment0,
  segment1,
  segment2,
  segment3,
  segment4,
];

final segment0 = [
  Block(Vector2(0, 0), GroundBlock),
  Block(Vector2(1, 0), GroundBlock),
  Block(Vector2(2, 0), GroundBlock),
  Block(Vector2(3, 0), GroundBlock),
  Block(Vector2(4, 0), GroundBlock),
  Block(Vector2(5, 0), GroundBlock),
  Block(Vector2(5, 1), WaterEnemy),
  Block(Vector2(5, 3), PlatformBlock),
  Block(Vector2(6, 0), GroundBlock),
  Block(Vector2(6, 3), PlatformBlock),
  Block(Vector2(7, 0), GroundBlock),
  Block(Vector2(7, 3), PlatformBlock),
  Block(Vector2(8, 0), GroundBlock),
  Block(Vector2(8, 3), PlatformBlock),
  Block(Vector2(9, 0), GroundBlock),
];

final segment1 = [
  Block(Vector2(0, 0), GroundBlock),
  Block(Vector2(1, 0), GroundBlock),
  Block(Vector2(1, 1), PlatformBlock),
  Block(Vector2(1, 2), PlatformBlock),
  Block(Vector2(1, 3), PlatformBlock),
  Block(Vector2(2, 6), PlatformBlock),
  Block(Vector2(3, 6), PlatformBlock),
  Block(Vector2(6, 5), PlatformBlock),
  Block(Vector2(7, 5), PlatformBlock),
  Block(Vector2(7, 7), Star),
  Block(Vector2(8, 0), GroundBlock),
  Block(Vector2(8, 1), PlatformBlock),
  Block(Vector2(8, 5), PlatformBlock),
  Block(Vector2(8, 6), WaterEnemy),
  Block(Vector2(9, 0), GroundBlock),
];

final segment2 = [
  Block(Vector2(0, 0), GroundBlock),
  Block(Vector2(1, 0), GroundBlock),
  Block(Vector2(2, 0), GroundBlock),
  Block(Vector2(3, 0), GroundBlock),
  Block(Vector2(3, 3), PlatformBlock),
  Block(Vector2(4, 0), GroundBlock),
  Block(Vector2(4, 3), PlatformBlock),
  Block(Vector2(5, 0), GroundBlock),
  Block(Vector2(5, 3), PlatformBlock),
  Block(Vector2(5, 4), WaterEnemy),
  Block(Vector2(6, 0), GroundBlock),
  Block(Vector2(6, 3), PlatformBlock),
  Block(Vector2(6, 4), PlatformBlock),
  Block(Vector2(6, 5), PlatformBlock),
  Block(Vector2(6, 7), Star),
  Block(Vector2(7, 0), GroundBlock),
  Block(Vector2(8, 0), GroundBlock),
  Block(Vector2(9, 0), GroundBlock),
];

final segment3 = [
  Block(Vector2(0, 0), GroundBlock),
  Block(Vector2(1, 0), GroundBlock),
  Block(Vector2(1, 1), WaterEnemy),
  Block(Vector2(2, 0), GroundBlock),
  Block(Vector2(2, 1), PlatformBlock),
  Block(Vector2(2, 2), PlatformBlock),
  Block(Vector2(4, 4), PlatformBlock),
  Block(Vector2(6, 6), PlatformBlock),
  Block(Vector2(7, 0), GroundBlock),
  Block(Vector2(7, 1), PlatformBlock),
  Block(Vector2(8, 0), GroundBlock),
  Block(Vector2(8, 8), Star),
  Block(Vector2(9, 0), GroundBlock),
];

final segment4 = [
  Block(Vector2(0, 0), GroundBlock),
  Block(Vector2(1, 0), GroundBlock),
  Block(Vector2(2, 0), GroundBlock),
  Block(Vector2(2, 3), PlatformBlock),
  Block(Vector2(3, 0), GroundBlock),
  Block(Vector2(3, 1), WaterEnemy),
  Block(Vector2(3, 3), PlatformBlock),
  Block(Vector2(4, 0), GroundBlock),
  Block(Vector2(5, 0), GroundBlock),
  Block(Vector2(5, 5), PlatformBlock),
  Block(Vector2(6, 0), GroundBlock),
  Block(Vector2(6, 5), PlatformBlock),
  Block(Vector2(6, 7), Star),
  Block(Vector2(7, 0), GroundBlock),
  Block(Vector2(8, 0), GroundBlock),
  Block(Vector2(8, 3), PlatformBlock),
  Block(Vector2(9, 0), GroundBlock),
  Block(Vector2(9, 1), WaterEnemy),
  Block(Vector2(9, 3), PlatformBlock),
];
```

### Loading the Segments into the World

Now that our segments are defined, we need to create a way to load these blocks into our world. To
do that, we are going to start work in the `ember_quest.dart` file. We will create a `loadSegments`
method that when given an index for the segments list, will then loop through that segment from
our `segment_manager` and we will add the appropriate blocks later. It should look like this:

```dart
void loadGameSegments(int segmentIndex, double xPositionOffset) {
    for (final block in segments[segmentIndex]) {
      switch (block.blockType) {
        case GroundBlock:
        case PlatformBlock:
        case Star:
        case WaterEnemy:
      }
    }
  }
```

You will need to add the following imports if they were not auto-imported:

```dart
import 'actors/water_enemy.dart';
import 'managers/segment_manager.dart';
import 'objects/ground_block.dart';
import 'objects/platform_block.dart';
import 'objects/star.dart';
```

Now we can refactor our game a bit and create an `initializeGame()` method which will call our
`loadGameSegments` method.

```dart
  void initializeGame() {
    // Assume that size.x < 3200
    final segmentsToLoad = (size.x / 640).ceil();
    segmentsToLoad.clamp(0, segments.length);

    for (var i = 0; i <= segmentsToLoad; i++) {
      loadGameSegments(i, (640 * i).toDouble());
    }

    _ember = EmberPlayer(
      position: Vector2(128, canvasSize.y - 70),
    );
    world.add(_ember);
  }
```

We simply are taking the width of the game screen, divide that by 640 (10 blocks in a segment times
64 pixels wide for each block), and round that up. As we only defined 5 segments total, we need to
restrict that integer from 0 to the length of the segments list in case the user has a really wide
screen. Then we simply loop through the number of `segmentsToLoad` and call `loadGameSegments` with
the integer to load and then calculate the offset.

Additionally, I have moved the Ember-related code from the `onLoad` method to our new
`initializeGame` method. This means I can now make the call in `onLoad` to `initializeGame` such
as:

```dart
@override
  Future<void> onLoad() async {
    await images.loadAll([
      'block.png',
      'ember.png',
      'ground.png',
      'heart_half.png',
      'heart.png',
      'star.png',
      'water_enemy.png',
    ]);

    camera.viewfinder.anchor = Anchor.topLeft;
    initializeGame();
  }
```

At this point, you probably have errors for all the object classes and the enemy class, but don't
worry, we will solve those right now.

### The Platform Block

One of the easiest blocks to start with is the Platform Block. There are two things that we need to
develop beyond getting the sprite to be displayed; that is, we need to place it in the correct
position and as Ember moves across the screen, we need to remove the blocks once they are off the
screen. In Ember Quest, the player can only move forward, so this will keep the game lightweight as
it's an infinite level.

Open the `lib/objects/platform_block.dart` file and add the following code:

```dart
import 'package:flame/collisions.dart';
import 'package:flame/components.dart';

import '../ember_quest.dart';

class PlatformBlock extends SpriteComponent
    with HasGameReference<EmberQuestGame> {
  final Vector2 gridPosition;
  double xOffset;

  PlatformBlock({
    required this.gridPosition,
    required this.xOffset,
  }) : super(size: Vector2.all(64), anchor: Anchor.bottomLeft);

  @override
  void onLoad() {
  }

  @override
  void update(double dt) {
    super.update(dt);
  }
}
```

We are going to extend the Flame `SpriteComponent` and we will need the `HasGameRef` mixin to access
our game class just like we did before. We are starting with the empty `onLoad` and `update`
methods and we will begin adding code to create the functionality that is necessary for the game.

The secret to any gaming engine is the game loop. This is an infinite loop that calls all the
objects in your game so you can provide updates. The `update` method is the hook into this and it
uses a `double dt` to pass to your method the amount of time in seconds since it was last
called. This `dt` variable then allows you to calculate how far your component needs to move
on-screen.

All components in our game will need to move at the same speed, so to do this, open
`lib/ember_quest.dart`, and let's define a global variable called `objectSpeed`. At the top of the
`EmberQuestGame` class, add:

```dart
  late EmberPlayer _ember;
  double objectSpeed = 0.0;
```

So to implement that movement, declare a variable at the top of the `PlatformBlock` class and make
your `update` method look like this:

```dart
final Vector2 velocity = Vector2.zero();
```

```dart
  @override
  void update(double dt) {
    velocity.x = game.objectSpeed;
    position += velocity * dt;
    if (position.x < -size.x) removeFromParent();
    super.update(dt);
  }
```

All that is happening is we define a base `velocity` that is instantiated at 0 on both axes and then
we update `velocity` using the global `objectSpeed` variable for the x-axis. As this is our
platform block, it will only scroll left and right, so our y-axis in the `velocity` will always be 0
as do not want our blocks jumping.

Next, we update the `position` which is a special variable built into the Flame engine components.
By multiplying the `velocity` vector by the `dt` we can move our component to the required amount.

Finally, if `x` value of position is `-size.x` (this means off the left side of the screen by the
width of the image) then remove this platform block from the game entirely.

Now we just need to finish the `onLoad` method. So make your `onLoad` method look like this:

```dart
  @override
  void onLoad() {
    final platformImage = game.images.fromCache('block.png');
    sprite = Sprite(platformImage);
    position = Vector2((gridPosition.x * size.x) + xOffset,
        game.size.y - (gridPosition.y * size.y),
    );
    add(RectangleHitbox(collisionType: CollisionType.passive));
  }
```

First, we retrieve the image from cache as we did before, and because this is a `SpriteComponent`
we can use the built-in `sprite` variable to assign the image to the component. Next, we need to
calculate its starting position. This is where all the magic happens, so let's break this down.

Just like in the `update` method we will be setting the `position` variable to a `Vector2`. To
determine where it needs to be, we need to calculate the x and y positions. Focusing on the x
first, we can see that we are taking `gridPosition.x` times the width of the image and then we will
add that to the `xOffset` that we pass in. With the y-axis, we will take the height of the
game and we will subtract the `gridPosition.y` times the height of the image.

Lastly, as we want Ember to be able to interact with the platform, we will add a `RectangleHitbox`
with a `passive` `CollisionType`. Collisions will be explained more in a later chapter.

#### Display the Platform

In our `loadGameSegments` method from earlier, we will need to add the call to add our block. We
will need to define `gridPosition` and `xOffset` to be passed in. `gridPosition` will be a
`Vector2` and `xOffset` is a double as that will be used to calculate the x-axis offset for
the block in a `Vector2`. So add the following to your `loadGameSegments` method:

```dart
case PlatformBlock:
  add(PlatformBlock(
    gridPosition: block.gridPosition,
    xOffset: xPositionOffset,
  ));
```

If you run your code, you should now see:

![Platforms Displayed](../../images/tutorials/platformer/Step3Platforms.jpg)

While this does run, the black just makes it look like Ember is in a dungeon. Let's change that
background real quick so there is a nice blue sky. Just add the following code to
`lib/ember_quest.dart`:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

@override
Color backgroundColor() {
  return const Color.fromARGB(255, 173, 223, 247);
}
```

Excellent! Ember is now in front of a blue sky.

On to [](step_4.md), where we will add the rest of the components now that we have a basic
understanding of what we are going to accomplish.

# 4. Adding the Remaining Components

## Star

The star is pretty simple. It is just like the Platform block except we are going to add an effect
to make it pulse in size. For the effect to look correct, we need to change the object's `Anchor`
to `center`. This means we will need to adjust the position by half of the image size. For brevity,
I am going to add the whole class and explain the additional changes after.

```dart
import 'package:flame/collisions.dart';
import 'package:flame/components.dart';
import 'package:flame/effects.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

import '../ember_quest.dart';

class Star extends SpriteComponent
    with HasGameReference<EmberQuestGame> {
  final Vector2 gridPosition;
  double xOffset;

  final Vector2 velocity = Vector2.zero();

  Star({
    required this.gridPosition,
    required this.xOffset,
  }) : super(size: Vector2.all(64), anchor: Anchor.center);

  @override
  void onLoad() {
    final starImage = game.images.fromCache('star.png');
    sprite = Sprite(starImage);
    position = Vector2(
      (gridPosition.x * size.x) + xOffset + (size.x / 2),
      game.size.y - (gridPosition.y * size.y) - (size.y / 2),
    );
    add(RectangleHitbox(collisionType: CollisionType.passive));
    add(
      SizeEffect.by(
        Vector2(-24, -24),
        EffectController(
          duration: .75,
          reverseDuration: .5,
          infinite: true,
          curve: Curves.easeOut,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  @override
  void update(double dt) {
    velocity.x = game.objectSpeed;
    position += velocity * dt;
    if (position.x < -size.x) removeFromParent();
    super.update(dt);
  }
}
```

So the only change between the Star and the Platform beyond the anchor is simply the following:

```dart
add(
  SizeEffect.by(
    Vector2(-24, -24),
    EffectController(
      duration: .75,
      reverseDuration: .5,
      infinite: true,
      curve: Curves.easeOut,
    ),
  ),
);
```

The `SizeEffect` is best explained by going to their
[docs](../../flame/effects.md#sizeeffectby). In short, we simply reduce the size of the star
by -24 pixels in both directions and we make it pulse infinitely using the `EffectController`.

Don't forget to add the star to your `lib/ember_quest.dart` file by doing:

```dart
case Star:
  world.add(
    Star(
      gridPosition: block.gridPosition,
      xOffset: xPositionOffset,
    ),
  );
```

If you run your game, you should now see pulsating stars!

## Water Enemy

Now that we understand adding effects to our objects, let's do the same for the water drop enemy.
Open `lib/actors/water_enemy.dart` and add the following code:

```dart
import 'package:flame/collisions.dart';
import 'package:flame/components.dart';
import 'package:flame/effects.dart';

import '../ember_quest.dart';

class WaterEnemy extends SpriteAnimationComponent
    with HasGameReference<EmberQuestGame> {
  final Vector2 gridPosition;
  double xOffset;

  final Vector2 velocity = Vector2.zero();

  WaterEnemy({
    required this.gridPosition,
    required this.xOffset,
  }) : super(size: Vector2.all(64), anchor: Anchor.bottomLeft);

  @override
  void onLoad() {
    animation = SpriteAnimation.fromFrameData(
      game.images.fromCache('water_enemy.png'),
      SpriteAnimationData.sequenced(
        amount: 2,
        textureSize: Vector2.all(16),
        stepTime: 0.70,
      ),
    );
    position = Vector2(
      (gridPosition.x * size.x) + xOffset,
      game.size.y - (gridPosition.y * size.y),
    );
    add(RectangleHitbox(collisionType: CollisionType.passive));
    add(
      MoveEffect.by(
        Vector2(-2 * size.x, 0),
        EffectController(
          duration: 3,
          alternate: true,
          infinite: true,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  @override
  void update(double dt) {
    velocity.x = game.objectSpeed;
    position += velocity * dt;
    if (position.x < -size.x) removeFromParent();
    super.update(dt);
  }
}

```

The water drop enemy is an animation just like Ember, so this class is extending the
`SpriteAnimationComponent` class but it uses all of the previous code we have used for the Star and
the Platform. The only difference will be instead of the `SizeEffect`, we are going to use the
`MoveEffect`. The best resource for information will be their [help
docs](../../flame/effects.md#sizeeffectby).

In short, the `MoveEffect` will last for 3 seconds, alternate directions, and run infinitely. It
will move our enemy to the left, 128 pixels (-2 x image width).

Don't forget to add the water enemy to your `lib/ember_quest.dart` file by doing:

```dart
case WaterEnemy:
    world.add(
      WaterEnemy(
       gridPosition: block.gridPosition,
       xOffset: xPositionOffset,
      ),
    );
```

If you run the game now, the Water Enemy should be displayed and moving!

![Water Enemies](../../images/tutorials/platformer/Step4Enemies.jpg)

## Ground Blocks

Finally, the last component that needs to be displayed is the Ground Block! This component is more
complex than the others as we need to identify two times during a block's life cycle.

- When the block is added, if it is the last block in the segment, we need to update a global value
  as to its position.
- When the block is removed, if it was the first block in the segment, we need to randomly get the
  next segment to load.

So let's start with the basic class which is nothing more than a copy of the Platform Block.

```dart
import 'package:flame/collisions.dart';
import 'package:flame/components.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

import '../ember_quest.dart';

class GroundBlock extends SpriteComponent with HasGameReference<EmberQuestGame> {
  final Vector2 gridPosition;
  double xOffset;

  final Vector2 velocity = Vector2.zero();

  GroundBlock({
    required this.gridPosition,
    required this.xOffset,
  }) : super(size: Vector2.all(64), anchor: Anchor.bottomLeft);

  @override
  void onLoad() {
    final groundImage = game.images.fromCache('ground.png');
    sprite = Sprite(groundImage);
    position = Vector2(
      gridPosition.x * size.x + xOffset,
      game.size.y - gridPosition.y * size.y,
    );
    add(RectangleHitbox(collisionType: CollisionType.passive));
  }

  @override
  void update(double dt) {
    velocity.x = game.objectSpeed;
    position += velocity * dt;
    super.update(dt);
  }
}
```

The first thing we will tackle is registering the block globally if it is the absolute last block to
be loaded. To do this, add two new global variables in `lib/ember_quest.dart` called:

```dart
  late double lastBlockXPosition = 0.0;
  late UniqueKey lastBlockKey;
```

Declare the following variable at the top of your Ground Block class:

```dart
final UniqueKey _blockKey = UniqueKey();
```

Now in your Ground Block's `onLoad` method, add the following at the end of the method:

```dart
if (gridPosition.x == 9 && position.x > game.lastBlockXPosition) {
  game.lastBlockKey = _blockKey;
  game.lastBlockXPosition = position.x + size.x;
}
```

All that is happening is if this block is the 10th block (9 as the segment grid is 0 based) AND
this block's position is greater than the global `lastBlockXPosition`, set the global block key to be
this block's key and set the global `lastBlockXPosition` to be this blocks position plus the width of
the image (the anchor is bottom left and we want the next block to align right next to it).

Now we can address updating this information, so in the `update` method, add the following code:

```dart
  @override
  void update(double dt) {
    velocity.x = game.objectSpeed;
    position += velocity * dt;

    if (gridPosition.x == 9) {
      if (game.lastBlockKey == _blockKey) {
        game.lastBlockXPosition = position.x + size.x - 10;
      }
    }

    super.update(dt);
  }
```

`game.lastBlockXPosition` is being updated by the block's current x-axis position plus its width -
10 pixels. This will cause a little overlap, but due to the potential variance in `dt` this
prevents gaps in the map as it loads while a player is moving.

### Loading the Next Random Segment

To load the next random segment, we will use the `Random()` function that is built-in to
`dart:math`. The following line of code gets a random integer from 0 (inclusive) to the max number
in the passed parameter (exclusive).

```dart
Random().nextInt(segments.length),
```

Back in our Ground Block, we can now add the following to our 'update' method before
the other block we just added:

```dart
if (position.x < -size.x) {
  removeFromParent();
  if (gridPosition.x == 0) {
    game.loadGameSegments(
      Random().nextInt(segments.length),
      game.lastBlockXPosition,
    );
  }
}
```

This simply extends the code that we have in our other objects, where once the block is off the
screen and if the block is the first block of the segment, we will call the `loadGameSegments`
method in our game class, get a random number between 0 and the number of segments and pass in the
offset. If `Random()` or `segments.length` does not auto-import, you will need:

```dart
import 'dart:math';

import '../managers/segment_manager.dart';
```

So our full Ground Block class should look like this:

```dart
import 'dart:math';

import 'package:flame/collisions.dart';
import 'package:flame/components.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

import '../ember_quest.dart';
import '../managers/segment_manager.dart';

class GroundBlock extends SpriteComponent with HasGameReference<EmberQuestGame> {
  final Vector2 gridPosition;
  double xOffset;

  final UniqueKey _blockKey = UniqueKey();
  final Vector2 velocity = Vector2.zero();

  GroundBlock({
    required this.gridPosition,
    required this.xOffset,
  }) : super(size: Vector2.all(64), anchor: Anchor.bottomLeft);

  @override
  void onLoad() {
    final groundImage = game.images.fromCache('ground.png');
    sprite = Sprite(groundImage);
    position = Vector2(
      gridPosition.x * size.x + xOffset,
      game.size.y - gridPosition.y * size.y,
    );
    add(RectangleHitbox(collisionType: CollisionType.passive));
    if (gridPosition.x == 9 && position.x > game.lastBlockXPosition) {
      game.lastBlockKey = _blockKey;
      game.lastBlockXPosition = position.x + size.x;
    }
  }

  @override
  void update(double dt) {
    velocity.x = game.objectSpeed;
    position += velocity * dt;

    if (position.x < -size.x) {
      removeFromParent();
      if (gridPosition.x == 0) {
        game.loadGameSegments(
          Random().nextInt(segments.length),
          game.lastBlockXPosition,
        );
      }
    }
    if (gridPosition.x == 9) {
      if (game.lastBlockKey == _blockKey) {
        game.lastBlockXPosition = position.x + size.x - 10;
      }
    }

    super.update(dt);
  }
}

```

Finally, don't forget to add your Ground Block to `lib/ember_quest.dart` by adding the following:

```dart
case GroundBlock:
  world.add(
    GroundBlock(
      gridPosition: block.gridPosition,
      xOffset: xPositionOffset,
    ),
  );
```

If you run your code, your game should now look like this:

![Ground Blocks](../../images/tutorials/platformer/Step4Ground.jpg)

You might say, but wait! Ember is in the middle of the ground and that is correct because Ember's
`Anchor` is set to center. This is ok and we will be addressing this in [](step_5.md) where we will
be adding movement and collisions to Ember!

---

## File: tutorials/platformer/step_5.md

---

# 5. Controlling Movement

If you were waiting for some serious coding, this chapter is it. Prepare yourself as we dive in!

## Keyboard Controls

The first step will be to allow control of Ember via the keyboard. We need to start by adding the
appropriate mixins to the game class and Ember. Add the following:

`lib/ember_quest.dart`

```dart
import 'package:flame/events.dart';

class EmberQuestGame extends FlameGame with HasKeyboardHandlerComponents {
```

`lib/actors/ember.dart`

```dart
class EmberPlayer extends SpriteAnimationComponent
    with KeyboardHandler, HasGameReference<EmberQuestGame> {
```

Now we can add a new method:

```dart
  @override
  bool onKeyEvent(KeyEvent event, Set<LogicalKeyboardKey> keysPressed) {
    return true;
  }
```

Like before, if this did not trigger an auto-import, you will need the following:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/services.dart';
```

To control Ember's movement, it is easiest to set a variable where we think of the direction of
movement like a normalized vector, meaning the value will be restricted to -1, 0, or 1. So let's
set a variable at the top of the class:

```dart
  int horizontalDirection = 0;
```

Now in our `onKeyEvent` method, we can register the key pressed by adding:

```dart
@override
  bool onKeyEvent(KeyEvent event, Set<LogicalKeyboardKey> keysPressed) {
    horizontalDirection = 0;
    horizontalDirection += (keysPressed.contains(LogicalKeyboardKey.keyA) ||
            keysPressed.contains(LogicalKeyboardKey.arrowLeft))
        ? -1
        : 0;
    horizontalDirection += (keysPressed.contains(LogicalKeyboardKey.keyD) ||
            keysPressed.contains(LogicalKeyboardKey.arrowRight))
        ? 1
        : 0;

    return true;
  }
```

Let's make Ember move by adding a few lines of code and creating our `update` method. First, we
need to define a velocity variable for Ember. Add the following at the top of the `EmberPlayer`
class:

```dart
final Vector2 velocity = Vector2.zero();
final double moveSpeed = 200;
```

This establishes a base velocity of 0 and stores `moveSpeed` so we can adjust as necessary to suit
how the game-play should be. Next, add the `update` method with the following:

```dart
  @override
  void update(double dt) {
    velocity.x = horizontalDirection * moveSpeed;
    position += velocity * dt;
    super.update(dt);
  }
```

If you run the game now, Ember moves left and right using the arrow keys or the `A` and `D` keys.
You may have noticed that Ember doesn't look back if you are going left, to fix that, add the
following code at the end of your `update` method:

```dart
if (horizontalDirection < 0 && scale.x > 0) {
  flipHorizontally();
} else if (horizontalDirection > 0 && scale.x < 0) {
  flipHorizontally();
}
```

Now Ember looks in the direction they are traveling.

## Collisions

It is time to get into the thick of it with collisions. I highly suggest reading the
[documentation](../../flame/collision_detection.md) to understand how collisions work in Flame. The
first thing we need to do is make the game aware that collisions are going to occur using the
`HasCollisionDetection` mixin. Add that to `lib/ember_quest.dart` like:

```dart
class EmberQuestGame extends FlameGame
    with HasCollisionDetection, HasKeyboardHandlerComponents {
```

Next, add the `CollisionCallbacks` mixin to `lib/actors/ember.dart` like:

```dart
class EmberPlayer extends SpriteAnimationComponent
    with KeyboardHandler, CollisionCallbacks, HasGameReference<EmberQuestGame> {
```

If it did not auto-import, you will need the following:

```dart
import 'package:flame/collisions.dart';
```

Now add the following `onCollision` method:

```dart
@override
void onCollision(Set<Vector2> intersectionPoints, PositionComponent other) {
  if (other is GroundBlock || other is PlatformBlock) {
    if (intersectionPoints.length == 2) {
      // Calculate the collision normal and separation distance.
      final mid = (intersectionPoints.elementAt(0) +
        intersectionPoints.elementAt(1)) / 2;

      final collisionNormal = absoluteCenter - mid;
      final separationDistance = (size.x / 2) - collisionNormal.length;
      collisionNormal.normalize();

      // If collision normal is almost upwards,
      // ember must be on ground.
      if (fromAbove.dot(collisionNormal) > 0.9) {
        isOnGround = true;
      }

      // Resolve collision by moving ember along
      // collision normal by separation distance.
      position += collisionNormal.scaled(separationDistance);
      }
    }

  super.onCollision(intersectionPoints, other);
}
```

You will need to import the following:

```dart
import '../objects/ground_block.dart';
import '../objects/platform_block.dart';
```

As well as create these class variables:

```dart
  final Vector2 fromAbove = Vector2(0, -1);
  bool isOnGround = false;
```

For the collisions to be activated for Ember, we need to add a `CircleHitbox`, so in the `onLoad`
method, add the following:

```dart
add(CircleHitbox());
```

Now that we have the basic collisions created, we can add gravity so Ember exists in a game world
with very basic physics. To do that, we need to create some more variables:

```dart
  final double gravity = 15;
  final double jumpSpeed = 600;
  final double terminalVelocity = 150;

  bool hasJumped = false;
```

Now we can add Ember's ability to jump by adding the following to our `onKeyEvent` method:

```dart
hasJumped = keysPressed.contains(LogicalKeyboardKey.space);
```

Finally, in our `update` method we can tie this all together with:

```dart
// Apply basic gravity
velocity.y += gravity;

// Determine if ember has jumped
if (hasJumped) {
  if (isOnGround) {
    velocity.y = -jumpSpeed;
    isOnGround = false;
  }
  hasJumped = false;
}

// Prevent ember from jumping to crazy fast as well as descending too fast and
// crashing through the ground or a platform.
velocity.y = velocity.y.clamp(-jumpSpeed, terminalVelocity);
```

Earlier I mentioned that Ember was in the center of the grass, to solve this and show how collisions
and gravity work with Ember, I like to add a little drop-in when you start the game. So in
`lib/ember_quest.dart` in the `initializeGame` method, change the following:

```dart
_ember = EmberPlayer(
  position: Vector2(128, canvasSize.y - 128),
);
```

If you run the game now, Ember should be created and fall to the ground; then you can jump around!

### Collisions with Objects

Adding the collisions with the other objects is fairly trivial. All we need to do is add the
following to the bottom of the `onCollision` method:

```dart
if (other is Star) {
  other.removeFromParent();
}

if (other is WaterEnemy) {
  hit();
}
```

When Ember collides with a star, the game will remove the star, and to implement the `hit` method for
when Ember collides with an enemy, we need to do the following:

Add the following variable at the top of the `EmberPlayer` class:

```dart
bool hitByEnemy = false;
```

Additionally, add this method to the `EmberPlayer` class:

```dart
// This method runs an opacity effect on ember
// to make it blink.
void hit() {
  if (!hitByEnemy) {
    hitByEnemy = true;
  }
  add(
    OpacityEffect.fadeOut(
    EffectController(
      alternate: true,
      duration: 0.1,
      repeatCount: 6,
    ),
    )..onComplete = () {
      hitByEnemy = false;
    },
  );
}
```

If the auto-imports did not occur, you will need to add the following imports to your file:

```dart
import 'package:flame/effects.dart';

import '../objects/star.dart';
import 'water_enemy.dart';
```

If you run the game now, you should be able to move around, make stars disappear, and if you
collide with an enemy, Ember should blink.

## Adding the Scrolling

This is our last task with Ember. We need to restrict Ember's movement because as of now, Ember can
go off-screen and we never move the map. So to implement this feature, we simply need to add the
following to the end of our `update` method:

```dart
game.objectSpeed = 0;
// Prevent ember from going backwards at screen edge.
if (position.x - 36 <= 0 && horizontalDirection < 0) {
  velocity.x = 0;
}
// Prevent ember from going beyond half screen.
if (position.x + 64 >= game.size.x / 2 && horizontalDirection > 0) {
  velocity.x = 0;
  game.objectSpeed = -moveSpeed;
}

position += velocity * dt;
super.update(dt);
```

If you run the game now, Ember can't move off-screen to the left, and as Ember moves to the right,
once they get to the middle of the screen, the rest of the objects scroll by. This is because we
are now updating `game.objectSpeed` which we established early on in the series. Additionally,
you will see the next random segment be generated and added to the level based on the work we did in
Ground Block.

```{note}
As I mentioned earlier, I would add a section on how this game could be adapted
to a traditional level game. As we built the segments in [](step_3.md), we
could add a segment that has a door or a special block. For every `X` number of
segments loaded, we could then add that special segment. When Ember reaches that
object, we could reload the level and start all over maintaining the stars
collected and health.
```

We are almost done! In [](step_6.md), we will add the health system, keep track of
the score, and provide a HUD to relay that information to the player.

---

## File: tutorials/platformer/step_6.md

---

# 6. Adding the HUD

## Setting up the HUD

Now that the game is up and running, the rest of the code should come fairly easily. To prepare for
the hud, we need to add some variables in `lib/ember_quest.dart`. Add the following to the top of
the class:

```dart
int starsCollected = 0;
int health = 3;
```

Start by creating a folder called `lib/overlays`, and in that folder, create a component called
`heart.dart`. This is going to be the health monitoring component in the upper left-hand corner of
the game. Add the following code:

```dart
import 'package:ember_quest/ember_quest.dart';
import 'package:flame/components.dart';

enum HeartState {
  available,
  unavailable,
}

class HeartHealthComponent extends SpriteGroupComponent<HeartState>
    with HasGameReference<EmberQuestGame> {
  final int heartNumber;

  HeartHealthComponent({
    required this.heartNumber,
    required super.position,
    required super.size,
    super.scale,
    super.angle,
    super.anchor,
    super.priority,
  });

  @override
  Future<void> onLoad() async {
    await super.onLoad();
    final availableSprite = await game.loadSprite(
      'heart.png',
      srcSize: Vector2.all(32),
    );

    final unavailableSprite = await game.loadSprite(
      'heart_half.png',
      srcSize: Vector2.all(32),
    );

    sprites = {
      HeartState.available: availableSprite,
      HeartState.unavailable: unavailableSprite,
    };

    current = HeartState.available;
  }

  @override
  void update(double dt) {
    if (game.health < heartNumber) {
      current = HeartState.unavailable;
    } else {
      current = HeartState.available;
    }
    super.update(dt);
  }
}

```

The `HeartHealthComponent` is just a [SpriteGroupComponent](../../flame/components/sprite_components.md#spritegroupcomponent)
that uses the heart images that were created early on. The unique thing that is being done, is when
the component is created, it requires a `heartNumber`, so in the `update` method, we check to see if
the `game.health` is less than the `heartNumber` and if so, change the state of the component to
unavailable.

To put this all together, create `hud.dart` in the same folder and add the following code:

```dart
import 'package:flame/components.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

import '../ember_quest.dart';
import 'heart.dart';

class Hud extends PositionComponent with HasGameReference<EmberQuestGame> {
  Hud({
    super.position,
    super.size,
    super.scale,
    super.angle,
    super.anchor,
    super.children,
    super.priority = 5,
  });

  late TextComponent _scoreTextComponent;

  @override
  Future<void> onLoad() async {
    _scoreTextComponent = TextComponent(
      text: '${game.starsCollected}',
      textRenderer: TextPaint(
        style: const TextStyle(
          fontSize: 32,
          color: Color.fromRGBO(10, 10, 10, 1),
        ),
      ),
      anchor: Anchor.center,
      position: Vector2(game.size.x - 60, 20),
    );
    add(_scoreTextComponent);

    final starSprite = await game.loadSprite('star.png');
    add(
      SpriteComponent(
        sprite: starSprite,
        position: Vector2(game.size.x - 100, 20),
        size: Vector2.all(32),
        anchor: Anchor.center,
      ),
    );

    for (var i = 1; i <= game.health; i++) {
      final positionX = 40 * i;
      await add(
        HeartHealthComponent(
          heartNumber: i,
          position: Vector2(positionX.toDouble(), 20),
          size: Vector2.all(32),
        ),
      );
    }
  }

  @override
  void update(double dt) {
    _scoreTextComponent.text = '${game.starsCollected}';
  }
}

```

In the `onLoad` method, you can see where we loop from 1 to the `game.health` amount, to create
the number of hearts necessary. The last step is to add the hud to the game.

Go to `lib/ember_quest.dart` and add the following code in the `initializeGame` method:

```dart
camera.viewport.add(Hud());
```

If the auto-import did not occur, you will need to add:

```dart
import 'overlays/hud.dart';
```

If you run the game now, you should see:

![HUD Loaded](../../images/tutorials/platformer/Step6HUD.jpg)

## Updating the HUD Data

The last thing we need to do before closing out the HUD is to update the data. To do this, we need
to open `lib/actors/ember.dart` and add the following code:

`onCollision`

```dart
if (other is Star) {
  other.removeFromParent();
  game.starsCollected++;
}
```

```dart
void hit() {
  if (!hitByEnemy) {
    game.health--;
    hitByEnemy = true;
  }
  add(
    OpacityEffect.fadeOut(
      EffectController(
        alternate: true,
        duration: 0.1,
        repeatCount: 5,
      ),
    )..onComplete = () {
      hitByEnemy = false;
    },
  );
}
```

If you run the game now, you will see that your health is updated and the stars are incremented as
appropriate. Finally, in [](step_7), we will finish the game by adding the main menu and the
game-over menu.

## File: tutorials/platformer/step_7.md

# 7. Adding Menus

To add menus to the game, we will leverage Flame's built-in
[overlay](../../flame/overlays.md) system.

## Main Menu

In the `lib/overlays` folder, create `main_menu.dart` and add the following code:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

import '../ember_quest.dart';

class MainMenu extends StatelessWidget {
  // Reference to parent game.
  final EmberQuestGame game;

  const MainMenu({super.key, required this.game});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    const blackTextColor = Color.fromRGBO(0, 0, 0, 1.0);
    const whiteTextColor = Color.fromRGBO(255, 255, 255, 1.0);

    return Material(
      color: Colors.transparent,
      child: Center(
        child: Container(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(10.0),
          height: 250,
          width: 300,
          decoration: const BoxDecoration(
            color: blackTextColor,
            borderRadius: const BorderRadius.all(
              Radius.circular(20),
            ),
          ),
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              const Text(
                'Ember Quest',
                style: TextStyle(
                  color: whiteTextColor,
                  fontSize: 24,
                ),
              ),

              SizedBox(
                width: 200,
                height: 75,
                child: ElevatedButton(
                  onPressed: () {
                    game.overlays.remove('MainMenu');
                  },

                    backgroundColor: whiteTextColor,

                      color: blackTextColor,
                    ),
                  ),
                ),
              ),

              const Text(

              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

```

This is a pretty self-explanatory file that just uses standard Flutter widgets to display
information and provide a `Play` button. The only Flame-related line is
`game.overlays.remove('MainMenu');` which simply removes the overlay so the user can play the
game. It should be noted that the user can technically move Ember while this is displayed, but
trapping the input is outside the scope of this tutorial as there are multiple ways this can be
accomplished.

## Game Over Menu

Next, create a file called `lib/overlays/game_over.dart` and add the following code:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

import '../ember_quest.dart';

class GameOver extends StatelessWidget {
  // Reference to parent game.
  final EmberQuestGame game;
  const GameOver({super.key, required this.game});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    const blackTextColor = Color.fromRGBO(0, 0, 0, 1.0);
    const whiteTextColor = Color.fromRGBO(255, 255, 255, 1.0);

    return Material(
      color: Colors.transparent,
      child: Center(
        child: Container(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(10.0),
          height: 200,
          width: 300,
          decoration: const BoxDecoration(
            color: blackTextColor,
            borderRadius: const BorderRadius.all(
              Radius.circular(20),
            ),
          ),
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              const Text(
                'Game Over',
                style: TextStyle(
                  color: whiteTextColor,
                  fontSize: 24,
                ),
              ),
              const SizedBox(height: 40),
              SizedBox(
                width: 200,
                height: 75,
                child: ElevatedButton(
                  onPressed: () {
                    game.reset();
                    game.overlays.remove('GameOver');
                  },
                  style: ElevatedButton.styleFrom(
                    backgroundColor: whiteTextColor,
                  ),
                  child: const Text(
                    'Play Again',
                    style: TextStyle(
                      fontSize: 28.0,
                      color: blackTextColor,
                    ),
                  ),
                ),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

As with the Main Menu, this is all standard Flutter widgets except for the call to remove the
overlay and also the call to `game.reset()` which we will create now.

Open `lib/ember_quest.dart` and add / update the following code:

```dart
@override
Future<void> onLoad() async {
  await images.loadAll([
      'block.png',
      'ember.png',
      'ground.png',
      'heart_half.png',
      'heart.png',
      'star.png',
      'water_enemy.png',
  ]);

  camera.viewfinder.anchor = Anchor.topLeft;
  initializeGame(true);
}

void initializeGame(bool loadHud) {
  // Assume that size.x < 3200
  final segmentsToLoad = (size.x / 640).ceil();
  segmentsToLoad.clamp(0, segments.length);

  for (var i = 0; i <= segmentsToLoad; i++) {
    loadGameSegments(i, (640 * i).toDouble());
  }

  _ember = EmberPlayer(
    position: Vector2(128, canvasSize.y - 128),
  );
  add(_ember);
  if (loadHud) {
    add(Hud());
  }
}

void reset() {
  starsCollected = 0;
  health = 3;
  initializeGame(false);
}
```

You may notice that we have added a parameter to the `initializeGame` method which allows us to
bypass adding the HUD to the game. This is because in the coming section, when Ember's health drops
to 0, we will wipe the game, but we do not need to remove the HUD, as we just simply need to reset
the values using `reset()`.

## Displaying the Menus

To display the menus, add the following code to `lib/main.dart`:

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(
    GameWidget<EmberQuestGame>.controlled(
      gameFactory: EmberQuestGame.new,
      overlayBuilderMap: {
        'MainMenu': (_, game) => MainMenu(game: game),
        'GameOver': (_, game) => GameOver(game: game),
      },
      initialActiveOverlays: const ['MainMenu'],
    ),
  );
}
```

If the menus did not auto-import, add the following:

```dart
import 'overlays/game_over.dart';
import 'overlays/main_menu.dart';
```

If you run the game now, you should be greeted with the Main Menu overlay. Pressing play will
remove it and allow you to start playing the game.

### Health Check for Game Over

Our last step to finish Ember Quest is to add a game-over mechanism. This is fairly simple but
requires us to place similar code in all of our components. So let's get started!

In `lib/actors/ember.dart`, in the `update` method, add the following:

```dart
// If ember fell in pit, then game over.
if (position.y > game.size.y + size.y) {
  game.health = 0;
}

if (game.health <= 0) {
  removeFromParent();
}
```

In `lib/actors/water_enemy.dart`, in the `update` method update the following code:

```dart
if (position.x < -size.x || game.health <= 0) {
  removeFromParent();
}
```

In `lib/objects/ground_block.dart`, in the `update` method update the following code:

```dart
if (game.health <= 0) {
  removeFromParent();
}
```

In `lib/objects/platform_block.dart`, in the `update` method update the following code:

```dart
if (position.x < -size.x || game.health <= 0) {
  removeFromParent();
}
```

In `lib/objects/star.dart`, in the `update` method update the following code:

```dart
if (position.x < -size.x || game.health <= 0) {
  removeFromParent();
}
```

Finally, in `lib/ember_quest.dart`, add the following `update` method:

```dart
@override
void update(double dt) {
  if (health <= 0) {
    overlays.add('GameOver');
  }
  super.update(dt);
}
```

# Space Shooter Game Tutorial

In this tutorial, we will follow a step-by-step process for coding a game using the Flame
engine.

This tutorial assumes that you have at least some familiarity with common programming concepts, and
with the [Dart] programming language.

# Getting Started

This tutorial will guide you on the development of a full Flame game, starting from the ground up,
step by step. By the end of it, you will have built a classic Space Shooter game, featuring
animations, input using gestures, mouse and keyboard controls, collision detections, and so on.

This first part will introduce you to:

- `FlameGame`: The base class for games using the Flame Component System.
- `GameWidget`: The `Widget` that will insert your game into the Flutter widget tree.
- `PositionComponent`: One of the most basic Flame components holds both a position and
  dimension in the game space.

Let's start by creating our game class and the `GameWidget` that will run it.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flame/game.dart';

class SpaceShooterGame extends FlameGame {
}

void main() {
  runApp(GameWidget(game: SpaceShooterGame()));
}
```

That is it! If you run this, you will only see an empty black screen for now, from that, we can
start implementing our game.

Next, let's create our player component. To do so, we will create a new class based on Flame's
`PositionComponent`. This component is the base for all components that have a position and a size
on the game screen. For now, our component will only render a white square; it could be
implemented as follows:

```dart
import 'package:flame/components.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class Player extends PositionComponent {
  static final _paint = Paint()..color = Colors.white;

  @override
  void render(Canvas canvas) {
    canvas.drawRect(size.toRect(), _paint);
  }
}
```

Now, let's add our new component to the game. Adding any component on game startup should be done
in the `onLoad` method, so let's override `FlameGame.onLoad` and add our logic there. The modified
code will look like the following:

```dart
class SpaceShooterGame extends FlameGame {
  @override
  Future<void> onLoad() async {
    await super.onLoad();

    add(
      Player()
        ..position = size / 2
        ..width = 50
        ..height = 100
        ..anchor = Anchor.center,
    );
  }
}
```

If you run this, you will now see a white rectangle being rendered in the center of the screen.

A couple of points worth commenting:

- `size` is a `Vector2` variable from the game class and it holds the current dimension of the game
  area, where `x` is the horizontal dimension or the width, and `y` is the vertical dimension or the
  height.
- By default, Flame follows Flutter's canvas anchoring, which means that (0, 0) is anchored on the
  top left corner of the canvas. So the game and all components use that same anchor by default. We
  can change this by changing our component's `anchor` attribute to `Anchor.center`, which will make
  our life way easier if you want to center the component on the screen.

And that is it for this first part! In this first step, we learned the basics of how to create a
game class, insert it into the Flutter widget tree, and render a simple component.

## Preparing the assets folder

Before we move on, let's prepare our project for the graphics we will be using in the next steps.
Games need assets such as images, sprites, and animations, and our Space Shooter is no exception.

First, create an `assets/images/` folder at the root of your project. Then tell Flutter about it
by adding the following lines to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
flutter:
  assets:
    - assets/images/
```

Your project structure should look like this:

```text
space_shooter/
 ├─assets/
 │  └─images/
 ├─lib/
 │  └─main.dart
 └─pubspec.yaml
```

In the following steps, we will provide the image files that need to be saved into the
`assets/images/` folder. Make sure to save each one as you encounter it.

```

[Next step: Controlling the player and adding some graphics](./step_2.md)

## File: tutorials/space_shooter/step_2.md

# Controlling the player and adding some graphics

Now that we have the base for our game and a component for our player, let's add some interactivity
to it. We can begin by allowing the player to be controlled by mouse/touch gestures.

There are a couple of ways of doing that in Flame. For this tutorial, we will do that by using one
of Flame's gesture detectors: `PanDetector`.

This detector will make our game class receive pan (or drag) events. To do so, we just need to add
the `PanDetector` mixin to our game class and override its listener methods; in our case, we will
use the `onPanUpdate` method. The updated code will look like the following:

```dart
import 'package:flame/input.dart';
import 'package:flame/events.dart';

class SpaceShooterGame extends FlameGame with PanDetector {
  late Player player;

  @override
  void onLoad() {
    // omitted
  }

  @override
  void onPanUpdate(DragUpdateInfo info) {
  }
}

```

At this point, our game should be receiving all the pan update inputs, but we are not doing anything
with these events.

We now need a way to move our player. That can be achieved by simply saving our `Player` component
to a variable inside our game class, adding a method `move` to our `Player`, and just connect
them:

```dart
class Player extends PositionComponent {
  static final _paint = Paint()..color = Colors.white;

  @override
  void render(Canvas canvas) {
    canvas.drawRect(size.toRect(), _paint);
  }

  void move(Vector2 delta) {
    position.add(delta);
  }
}

class SpaceShooterGame extends FlameGame with PanDetector {
  late Player player;

  @override
  Future<void> onLoad() async {
    await super.onLoad();

    player = Player()
      ..position = size / 2
      ..width = 50
      ..height = 100
      ..anchor = Anchor.center;

    add(player);
  }

  @override
  void onPanUpdate(DragUpdateInfo info) {
    player.move(info.delta.global);
  }
}
```

That is it! If you drag the screen, the player should follow your movement and we have just
implemented our very first interactive game!

Before we move to our next step, let's replace that boring white rectangle with some cool graphics.

Flame provides many classes to help us with graphical rendering. For this step, we are going to use
the `Sprite` class.

`Sprite`s are used in Flame to render static images or portions of them in the game. To render a
`Sprite` inside a `FlameGame`, we should use the `SpriteComponent` class, which wraps the `Sprite`
features into a component.

Before we write the code, we need the player sprite image. Right-click the image below, choose
"Save as...", and store it as `player-sprite.png` in your `assets/images/` folder:

![player-sprite](app/assets/images/player-sprite.png)

Now let's refactor our current implementation, first, we can replace our inheritance from
`PositionComponent` to `SpriteComponent` (which is a component that extends from
`PositionComponent`) and load the sprite:

```dart
class Player extends SpriteComponent {
  void move(Vector2 delta) {
    position.add(delta);
  }
}

class SpaceShooterGame extends FlameGame with PanDetector {
  late Player player;

  @override
  Future<void>? onLoad() async {
    await super.onLoad();

    final playerSprite = await loadSprite('player-sprite.png');
    player = Player()
      ..sprite = playerSprite
      ..x = size.x / 2
      ..y = size.y / 2
      ..width = 50
      ..height = 100
      ..anchor = Anchor.center;

    add(player);
  }

  @override
  void onPanUpdate(DragUpdateInfo info) {
    player.move(info.delta.global);
  }
}
```

And now, you should see a small blue spaceship on the screen!

A couple of notes worth mentioning:

- Unlike `PositionComponent`, `SpriteComponent` has an implementation for the `render` method, so we
  can delete the previous override.
- `FlameGame` has a couple of methods for loading assets, like `loadSprite`. Those methods are
  quite useful, because when used, `FlameGame` will take care of cleaning any cache when the game is
  removed from the Flutter widget tree.

Before we close this step, there is one small improvement that we can do. Right now, we are loading
the sprite and passing it to our component. For now, this may seem fine, but imagine a game with
a lot of components; if the game is responsible for loading assets for all components, our code can
become a mess quite fast.

Just like `FlameGame`, components also have an `onLoad` method that can be overridden to do
initializations. But before we implement our player's load method, note that we use an attribute and
the `loadSprite` method from the `FlameGame` class.

That is not a problem! Every time our component needs to access things from its game class, we can
mix our component with the `HasGameReference` mixin; that will add a new variable to our component called
`game` which will point to the game instance where the component is running. Now, let's refactor
our game a little bit:

```dart
class Player extends SpriteComponent with HasGameReference<SpaceShooterGame> {

  Player() : super(
    size: Vector2(100, 150),
    anchor: Anchor.center,
  );

  @override
  Future<void> onLoad() async {
    await super.onLoad();

    sprite = await game.loadSprite('player-sprite.png');

    position = game.size / 2;
  }

  void move(Vector2 delta) {
    position.add(delta);
  }
}

class SpaceShooterGame extends FlameGame with PanDetector {
  late Player player;

  @override
  Future<void> onLoad() async {
    await super.onLoad();

    player = Player();

    add(player);
  }

  @override
  void onPanUpdate(DragUpdateInfo info) {
    player.move(info.delta.global);
  }
}
```

If you run the game now, you will not notice any visual differences, but now we have a more scalable
structure for developing our game. And that closes this step!

```

[Next step: Adding animations and depth](./step_3.md)

---

## File: tutorials/space_shooter/step_3.md

---

# Adding animations and depth

We now have something that looks more like a game, having graphics for our spaceship and being
able to directly control it.

But our game so far is too boring, the starship is just a static sprite and the background is
just a black screen.

In this step we will look at how to improve that, we will replace the static graphics of the player
with an animation and create a cool sense of depth and movement by adding a parallax to the
background of the game.

So lets start by adding the animation to the player ship! For that, we will something that we
call Sprite Animations, which is an animation that is composed by a collection of sprites, each
one representing one frame, and the animation effect is achieved by rendering one sprite after
the other over a time frame.

To better visualize this, this is the animation that we will be using, note how the image holds 4
individual images (or frames). Right-click the image below, choose "Save as...", and store it as
`player.png` in your `assets/images/` folder (replacing the static `player-sprite.png` we used
before):

![player](app/assets/images/player.png)

Flame provides us with a specialized classes to deal with such images: `SpriteAnimation` and its component
wrapper `SpriteAnimationComponent` and changing our `Player` component to be an animation is quite
simple, take a look at how the component will look like now:

```dart
class Player extends SpriteAnimationComponent
    with HasGameReference<SpaceShooterGame> {

  Player() : super(
    size: Vector2(100, 150),
    anchor: Anchor.center,
  );

  @override
  Future<void> onLoad() async {
    await super.onLoad();

    animation = await game.loadSpriteAnimation(
      'player.png',
      SpriteAnimationData.sequenced(
        amount: 4,
        stepTime: .2,
        textureSize: Vector2(32, 48),
      ),
    );

    position = game.size / 2;
  }

  // Other methods omitted
}
```

So lets break down the changes:

- First we changed our `Player` component to extend from `SpriteAnimationComponent` instead of
  `SpriteComponent`
- In the `onLoad` method we are now using the `game.loadSpriteAnimation` helper instead of the
  `loadSprite` one, and setting the `animation` attribute with its returned value.

The `SpriteAnimationData` class might look complicated at first glance, but it is actually quite
simple, note how we used the `sequenced` constructor, which is a helper to load animation images
where the frames are already laid down in the sequence that they will play, then:

- `amount` defines how many frames the animation has, in this case `4`
- `stepTime` is the time in seconds that each frame will be rendered, before it gets replaced
  with the next one.
- `textureSize` is the size in pixels which defines each frame of the image.

With all of this information, the `SpriteAnimationComponent` will now automatically play the
animation!

Now lets add some depth and energy to our game background. Of course there are many ways of
doing so, in this tutorial we will explore the idea of parallax scrolling. If you never heard
about it, it consist of a technique where background images move past the camera with different
speeds, this not only creates the sensation of depth but also improves the movement feeling
of the game a lot. If you want to read more about Parallax Scrolling, check this article
from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax_scrolling).

Flame provides classes to implement parallax scrolling out of the box, these classes are `Parallax` and
`ParallaxComponent`. We will need three star layer images for our parallax background. Right-click
each image below, choose "Save as...", and store them in your `assets/images/` folder:

- `stars_0.png` (farthest layer): ![stars_0](app/assets/images/stars_0.png)
- `stars_1.png` (middle layer): ![stars_1](app/assets/images/stars_1.png)
- `stars_2.png` (closest layer): ![stars_2](app/assets/images/stars_2.png)

Now lets take a look at how we can add that new feature to the game:

```dart
import 'package:flame/components.dart';
import 'package:flame/events.dart';
import 'package:flame/game.dart';
import 'package:flame/input.dart';
import 'package:flame/parallax.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class SpaceShooterGame extends FlameGame with PanDetector {
  late Player player;

  @override
  Future<void> onLoad() async {
    final parallax = await loadParallaxComponent(
      [
        ParallaxImageData('stars_0.png'),
        ParallaxImageData('stars_1.png'),
        ParallaxImageData('stars_2.png'),
      ],
      baseVelocity: Vector2(0, -5),
      repeat: ImageRepeat.repeat,
      velocityMultiplierDelta: Vector2(0, 5),
    );
    add(parallax);

    player = Player();
    add(player);
  }

  @override
  void onPanUpdate(DragUpdateInfo info) {
    player.move(info.delta.global);
  }
}
```

Looking at the code above we notice that we are now using the `loadParallaxComponent` helper
method from the `FlameGame` class to directly load a `ParallaxComponent` and add it to our game.

The arguments used there are as follows:

- The first argument is a positional one, which should be a list of `ParallaxData`s. There are a
  couple of types of `ParallaxData`s in Flame, in this tutorial we are using the `ParallaxImageData`
  which describes a layer in the parallax scrolling effect that is an `image`. This list will tell
  Flame about all the layers that we want in our parallax.
- `baseVelocity` is the base value for all the values, so by passing a `Vector2(0, -5)` to it
  means that the slower of the layers will move at 0 pixels per second on the `x` axis and `-5`
  pixels per second on the `y` axis.
- Finally `velocityMultiplierDelta` is a vector that is applied to the base value for each layer,
  and in our example the multiplication rate is `5` on only the `y` axis.

Give it a try by running the game now, you will notice that it looks way more dynamic now, giving a
more convincing feeling to the player that the spaceship is really crossing the stars!

# Adding bullets

For this next step we will add a very important feature to any space shooter game, shooting!

Here is how we will implement it: since we already control our space ship by dragging on the screen
with the mouse/fingers, we will make the ship auto shoot when the player starts dragging and
stop shooting when the gesture/input has ended.

First, let's create a `Bullet` component that will represent the shots in the game. We need a
bullet sprite for it. Right-click the image below, choose "Save as...", and store it as
`bullet.png` in your `assets/images/` folder:

![bullet](app/assets/images/bullet.png)

```dart
class Bullet extends SpriteAnimationComponent
    with HasGameReference<SpaceShooterGame> {
  Bullet({
    super.position,
  }) : super(
          size: Vector2(25, 50),
          anchor: Anchor.center,
        );

  @override
  Future<void> onLoad() async {
    await super.onLoad();

    animation = await game.loadSpriteAnimation(
      'bullet.png',
      SpriteAnimationData.sequenced(
        amount: 4,
        stepTime: .2,
        textureSize: Vector2(8, 16),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

So far, this does not introduce any new concepts, we just created a component and set
up its animations attributes.

The `Bullet` behavior is a simple one, it always moves towards the top of the screen and should
be removed from the game if it is not visible anymore, so let's add an `update` method to it
and make it happen:

```dart
class Bullet extends SpriteAnimationComponent
    with HasGameReference<SpaceShooterGame> {
  Bullet({
    super.position,
  }) : super(
          size: Vector2(25, 50),
          anchor: Anchor.center,
        );

  @override
  Future<void> onLoad() async {
    // Omitted
  }

  @override
  void update(double dt) {
    super.update(dt);

    position.y += dt * -500;

    if (position.y < -height) {
      removeFromParent();
    }
  }
}
```

The above code should be straight forward, but lets break it down:

- We add to the bullet's y axis position at a rate of -500 pixels per second. Remember going up
  in the y axis means getting closer to `0` since the top left corner of the screen is `0, 0`.
- If the y is smaller than the negative value of the bullet's height, means that the component is
  completely off the screen and it can be removed.

Right, we now have a `Bullet` class ready, so lets start to implement the action of shooting.
First thing, let's create two empty methods in the `Player` class, `startShooting()` and
`stopShooting()`.

```dart
class Player extends SpriteAnimationComponent
    with HasGameReference<SpaceShooterGame> {

  // Rest of implementation omitted

  void startShooting() {
    // TODO
  }

  void stopShooting() {
    // TODO
  }
}
```

And let's hook into those methods from the game class by using the `onPanStart()`
and `onPanEnd()` methods from the `PanDetector` mixin that we already have been using for the ship
movement:

```dart
class SpaceShooterGame extends FlameGame with PanDetector {
  late Player player;

  // Rest of implementation omitted

  @override
  void onPanUpdate(DragUpdateInfo info) {
    player.move(info.delta.global);
  }

  @override
  void onPanStart(DragStartInfo info) {
    player.startShooting();
  }

  @override
  void onPanEnd(DragEndInfo info) {
    player.stopShooting();
  }
}
```

We now have everything set up, so let's write the shooting routine in our player class.

Remember, the shooting behavior will be adding bullets through time intervals when the player is
dragging the starship.

We could implement the time interval code and the spawning manually, but Flame
provides a component out of the box for that, the `SpawnComponent`, so let's take advantage of it:

```dart
class Player extends SpriteAnimationComponent
    with HasGameReference<SpaceShooterGame> {
  late final SpawnComponent _bulletSpawner;

  @override
  Future<void> onLoad() async {
    // Loading animation omitted

    _bulletSpawner = SpawnComponent(
      period: .2,
      selfPositioning: true,
      factory: (index) {
        return Bullet(position: position + Vector2(0, -height / 2));
      },
      autoStart: false,
    );

    game.add(_bulletSpawner);
  }

  void move(Vector2 delta) {
    position.add(delta);
  }

  void startShooting() {
    _bulletSpawner.timer.start();
  }

  void stopShooting() {
    _bulletSpawner.timer.stop();
  }
}
```

Hopefully the code above speaks for itself, but let's look at it in more detail:

- First we declared a `SpawnComponent` called `_bulletSpawner` in our game class, we needed it
  to be an variable accessible to the whole component since we will be accessing it in the
  `startShooting` and `stopShooting` methods.
- We initialize our `_bulletSpawner` in the `onLoad` method. In the first argument, `period`, we set
  how much time in seconds it will take between calls, and we choose `.2` seconds for now.
- We set `selfPositioning: true` so the spawn component doesn't try to position the created component
  since we want to handle that ourselves to make the bullets spawn out of the ship.
- The `factory` attribute receives a function that will be called every time the `period` is  
  reached and return the created component.
- We set `autoStart: false` so it does not start by default.
- Finally we add the `_bulletSpawner` to our component, so it can be processed in the game loop.
- Note how the `_bulletSpawner` is added to the game instead of the player, since the bullets
  are part of the whole game and not the player itself.

With the `_bulletSpawner` all set up, the only missing piece now is starting the
`_bulletSpawner.timer` in `startShooting()` and stopping it in the `stopShooting()`!

And that closes this step, putting us real close to a real game!

[Next step: Adding Enemies](./step_5.md)

## File: tutorials/space_shooter/step_5.md

# Adding Enemies

Now that the starship is able to shoot, we need something for the player to shoot at! So for
this step we will work on adding enemies to the game.

First, let's create an `Enemy` class that will represent the enemies in game. Right-click the
image below, choose "Save as...", and store it as `enemy.png` in your `assets/images/` folder:

![enemy](app/assets/images/enemy.png)

```dart
class Enemy extends SpriteAnimationComponent
    with HasGameReference<SpaceShooterGame> {

  Enemy({
    super.position,
  }) : super(
          size: Vector2.all(enemySize),
          anchor: Anchor.center,
        );


  static const enemySize = 50.0;

  @override
  Future<void> onLoad() async {
    await super.onLoad();

    animation = await game.loadSpriteAnimation(
      'enemy.png',
      SpriteAnimationData.sequenced(
        amount: 4,
        stepTime: .2,
        textureSize: Vector2.all(16),
      ),
    );
  }

  @override
  void update(double dt) {
    super.update(dt);

    position.y += dt * 250;

    if (position.y > game.size.y) {
      removeFromParent();
    }
  }
}
```

Note that for now, the `Enemy` class is super similar to the `Bullet` one, the only differences are
their sizes, animation information and that bullets travel from bottom to top, while enemies travel from
top to bottom, so nothing new here.

Next we need to make the enemies spawn in the game, the logic here will be simple:
we will make enemies spawn from the top of the screen at a random position on the `x` axis.

Once again, we could manually add all the time based events in the game's `update()` method, maintain
a random instance to get the enemy x position and so on and so forth, but Flame provides us with a
way to avoid having to write all that by ourselves: we can use the `SpawnComponent`! So in the
`SpaceShooterGame.onLoad()` method let's add the following code:

```dart
    add(
      SpawnComponent(
        factory: (index) {
          return Enemy();
        },
        period: 1,
        area: Rectangle.fromLTWH(0, 0, size.x, -Enemy.enemySize),
      ),
    );
```

The `SpawnComponent` will take a couple of arguments, let's review them as they appear in the code:

- `factory` receives a function which has the index of the component that should be created. We
  don't use the index in our code, but it is useful to create more advanced spawn routines.
  This function should return the created component, in our case a new instance of `Enemy`.
- `period` simply define the interval in which a new component will be spawned.
- `area` defines the possible area where the components can be placed once created. In our case they
  should be placed in the area above the screen top, so they can be seen as they are arriving into the
  playable area.

And this concludes this short step!

[Next step: Collision Detection](./step_6.md)

## File: tutorials/space_shooter/step_6.md

# Enemies and Bullets collision

Right, we are really close to a playable game, we have enemies and we have the ability to shoot bullets
at them! We now need to do something when a bullet hits an enemy.

Flame provides a collision detection system out of the box, which we will use to implement our
logic when a bullet and an enemy come into contact. The result will be that both are removed!

First we need to let our `FlameGame` know that we want collisions between components to
be checked. In order to do so, simply add the `HasCollisionDetection` mixin to the declaration
of the game class:

```dart
class SpaceShooterGame extends FlameGame
    with PanDetector, HasCollisionDetection {
    // ...
}
```

With that, Flame now will start to check if components have collided with each other. Next we need to
identify which components can cause collisions.

In our case those are the `Bullet` and `Enemy` components and we need to add hitboxes to them.

A hitbox is nothing more than a defined part of the component's area that can hit
other objects. Flame offers a collection of classes to define a hitbox, the simplest of them is
the `RectangleHitbox`, which like the name implies, will set a rectangular area as the component's
hitbox.

Hitboxes are also components, so we can simply add them to the components that we want to have hitboxes.
Let's start by adding the following line to the `Enemy` class:

```dart
add(RectangleHitbox());
```

For the bullet we will do the same, but with a slight difference:

```dart
add(
  RectangleHitbox(
    collisionType: CollisionType.passive,
  ),
);
```

The `collisionType`s are very important to understand, since they can directly impact the game
performance!

There are three types of collisions in Flame:

- `active` collides with other hitboxes of type active or passive
- `passive` collides with other hitboxes of type active
- `inactive` will not collide with any other hitbox

Usually it is smart to mark `hitboxes` from components that will have a higher number of instances
as passive, so they will be taken into account for collision, but they themselves will not check
their own collisions, drastically reducing the number of checking, giving a better performance
to the game!

And since in this game we anticipate that there will be more bullets than enemies, we set the
bullets to have a passive collision type!

From this point on, Flame will take care of checking the collision between those two components and
we now need to do something when this occurs.

We start by receiving the collision events in one of the classes. Since `Bullet`s have a
passive collision type, we will also add the collision checking logic to the `Enemy` class.

To listen for collision events we need to add the `CollisionCallbacks` mixin to the component.
By doing so we will be able to override some methods like `onCollisionStart()` and `onCollisionEnd()`.

So let's make a few changes to the `Enemy` class:

```dart
class Enemy extends SpriteAnimationComponent
    with HasGameReference<SpaceShooterGame>, CollisionCallbacks {

  // Other methods omitted

  @override
  void onCollisionStart(
    Set<Vector2> intersectionPoints,
    PositionComponent other,
  ) {
    super.onCollisionStart(intersectionPoints, other);

    if (other is Bullet) {
      removeFromParent();
      other.removeFromParent();
    }
  }
}
```

As you can see, we added the mixin to the class, overrode the `onCollisionStart` method,
where we check whether the component that collided with us was a `Bullet` and if it was, then
we remove both the current `Enemy` instance and the `Bullet`.

If you run the game now you will finally be able to defeat the enemies crawling down the screen!

To add some final touches, let's add some explosion animations to introduce more action to the game!

First, we need an explosion sprite sheet. Right-click the image below, choose "Save as...", and
store it as `explosion.png` in your `assets/images/` folder:

![explosion](app/assets/images/explosion.png)

Now let's create the explosion class:

```dart
class Explosion extends SpriteAnimationComponent
    with HasGameReference<SpaceShooterGame> {
  Explosion({
    super.position,
  }) : super(
          size: Vector2.all(150),
          anchor: Anchor.center,
          removeOnFinish: true,
        );


  @override
  Future<void> onLoad() async {
    await super.onLoad();

    animation = await game.loadSpriteAnimation(
      'explosion.png',
      SpriteAnimationData.sequenced(
        amount: 6,
        stepTime: .1,
        textureSize: Vector2.all(32),
        loop: false,
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

There is not much new in it, the biggest difference compared to the other animation components is
that we are passing `loop: false` in the `SpriteAnimationData.sequenced` constructor and that we are
setting `removeOnFinish: true;`. We do that so that when the animation is finished, it will
automatically be removed from the game!

And finally, we make a small change in the `onCollisionStart()` method in the `Enemy` class
in order to add the explosion to the game:

```dart
  @override
  void onCollisionStart(
    Set<Vector2> intersectionPoints,
    PositionComponent other,
  ) {
    super.onCollisionStart(intersectionPoints, other);

    if (other is Bullet) {
      removeFromParent();
      other.removeFromParent();
      game.add(Explosion(position: position));
    }
  }
```

And that is it! We finally have a game which provides all the minimum necessary elements for a space
shooter, from here you can use what you learned to build more features in the game like making
the player suffer damage if it clashes with an enemy, or make the enemies shoot back, or maybe
both?

Good hunting pilot, and happy coding!
